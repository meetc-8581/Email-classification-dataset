Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias\
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume\
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it\
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for\
11 / 97 forward .\
i ' ve done some research as follows :\
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern\
marketing co . as counterparty )\
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001\
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .\
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102\
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101\
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .\
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport\
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089\
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to\
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport\
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each\
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking\
place .\
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for\
9 , 448 mmbtu .\
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it\
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used\
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in\
cpr or oss .\

here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi\
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we\
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get\
this assigned ? i can find old\
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let\
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?\
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for\
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved\
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and\
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with\
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it\
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i\
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved\
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :\
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left\
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed\
appropriately . someone\
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,\
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .\
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this\
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot\
allocate was is\
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?\
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point\
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203\
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the\
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this\
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in\
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved\
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december\
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back\
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .\
i haven ' t had time to do this yet . if we haven ' t figured out the assignement\
then i will get to it asap .|0

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,\
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august\
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .\
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south\
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number\
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by\
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began\
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and\
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail\
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -\
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a " synergi " contract number ) . i know that in\
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .\
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so\
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated\
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most\
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be\

Subject: monthly charges for analysts on your rc report\
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you\
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst\
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the\
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an\
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the\
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i\
have indicated below :\
detail class description amount\
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000\
552 benefits 774\
557 payroll taxes 360\
820 corporate services 1 , 266\
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400\
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not\
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in\
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .\
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,\
including campus recruiting and office visits .\
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled " a and a\
reclass " in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america\
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations\
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please\
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for\
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,\
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich\
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report\
each month going forward . thanks .\

Subject: sitara position\
please use the position manager home button .\
when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details\
or change the dates , the position manager keeps\
all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the\
back and forward buttons to keep your views running .\
on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to\
go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder\
to keep all the old views active and updated .\
the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had\
up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your\
position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .\
this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .\
if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,\
the position manager is still keeping all the your views for\
the day running in the backgound .\
what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out\
the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having\
30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position\
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .\
we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far\
as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be\
slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to\
limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time\
i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please\
remember to use your home button .\

did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool\

enron capital minnesota power\
and light co . , opinion no . 12 , issued april 14 , 1978 , mimeo at 24 - 5 .\
[ 65 , 229 ]\
in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was\
no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected\
cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the\
commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and\
specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to\
the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march\
30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the\
presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the\
record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential .\
the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal\
differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s\
filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to\
reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate\
design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the\
departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p .\
edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon\
it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build\
capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would\
give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore ,\
edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly ,\
edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on\
it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 .\
13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon\
by edison states that rates " shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the\
costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of\
the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . "\
( emphasis added . )\
further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from\
the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for\
hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and\
seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match\
more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order\
no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms\
based on marginal cost principles\
[ 65 , 236 ]\
for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,\
where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or\
eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the\
price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close\
matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average\
costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not\
be adopted .\
affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph\
comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos .\
er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 )\
turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly\
rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s\
interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence\
whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months .\
without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make\
a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we\
therefore uphold the judge on this point .\
we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s\
incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method\
proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are\
arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost\
estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs\
rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility\
may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff\
in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be\
made as frequently .\

[ 36 , 741 ]\
historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale\
rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to\
establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing\
rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but\
subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules .\
many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load\
management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations ,\
loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history\
of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also\
offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time\
ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 .\
these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement\
purpa - type standards where applicable .\
many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design\
of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging\
conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and\
equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity\
to examine these and other appropriate concepts .\
the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices\
on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant\
secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the\
power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the\
adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra\
6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the\
experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate\
design .\

( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing\

basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of\
consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary\
seasonally for such utility .\

pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a\
contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power\
supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices\
reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the\
revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while\
[ 32 , 174 ]\
the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load\
periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the\
price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided\
cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed\
payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be\
assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the\
variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity\
only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates\
for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of\
the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure\
that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates\
reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at\
the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors .\
to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the\
natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including\
forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts ,\
especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase\
quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and\
seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts .\

rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases\

methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated\

volume management should be fine with this change . all name changes will be\
still attached to the original path of the buy / sell deal . the settlement\
group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the\
deal has the appropriate ' statement group ' attached . other than that this\

fyi . . . .\
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the\
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .\
impact to logistics - unify\
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge\
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name\
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .\
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production\
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )\
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where\
nominations were sent for entire month )\
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe\
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .\
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause\
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order\
to get a clean quick response .\
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take\
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )\
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i\
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to\
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when\
these type of changes are needed .\
will keep you posted .\

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )\
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with\
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :\
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the\
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and\
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :\
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\
pipeline allows this change . "\
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\
feedback - i assume for the same reasons\
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\
in case it causes problems with their\
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\
the unify team .\
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\
market east - but not from\
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\
the same legal entity .\
" warning - not the same legal entity "\
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items\
were locked down for a reason .\
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\
data that was validated - and someone used these\
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\
using these deals will get corrupted . always check\
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\
unify .\

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )\
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be\
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other\
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .\
in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes\
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be\
necessary .\
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal\
manager .\
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out\
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .\
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you\
are looking for will appear .\
i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it\
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then\
updates its information\

due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops . the\
volumes @ this meter is for 4449 ( sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697 . due\
to this being a " check meter " the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops .\

subject : re : ena sales on hpl\
daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i\
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda\
needs . i am confused about praxair though .\
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .\
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial\
agreement .\
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it\
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to\
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .\
please advise .\

markham gas\
merit energy partners\
praxair\
reliant energy - entex\

ena has transacted with the other companies listed below , but that will most\
likely not happen again . ( hpl will trade with those counterparties . )\
all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara . we have reports which can be\
generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena . let me\
know if you need something like that .\

subject : ena sales on hpl\
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you\
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for\
which she is looking .\
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &\
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to\
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is\
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .\
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity\
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will\
this give me everything that i need ?\
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in\
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas\
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -\
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?\
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some\
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any\
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !\
thanks in advance .|0

texas has a 42 % increase year to year , a 22 % increase qtr . to qtr . and a 30 %\
increase mo . to mo . the yr . to yr . and qtr to qtr increases can be explained\
by an increase in eol transactions and entex taking more gas . the mo . to mo .\

effective immediately , ray bowen will take over leadership of the industrial\

activities in the industrial market including pulp & paper , metals , refining ,\
and petrochemicals . as part of the industrial origination group , jim ajello ,\

petrochemical sector . edward ondarza maintains oversight of origination in\
the pulp and paper sectors . rodney malcolm retains primary responsibility\
for leading the execution of transactions and delivery of the outsource\
solutions to industrial customers .\
when the commercial transactions group was created approximately a year ago ,\
the objective was to create an internal emphasis on the development of\
transaction execution skills that are necessary to execute complex ,\
structured transactions and to foster better deal quality . we believe that\
the primary objectives of the ctg have been achieved , and in order to better\
position the organization for the remainder of 2000 and in response to ray\
bowen  , s new position , the following changes will be made in the commercial\
transactions group organization .\
transaction development : transaction development , which was created to\
provide focused deal execution capability to the origination groups , will be\
merged into each respective origination group and report solely to the group\
leaders .\
portfolio management : all activities surrounding portfolio investments will\
report to jeff donahue . jeff will be responsible for ena  , s  & capital book  8\
and will have a high level of involvement in existing portfolio investments\

i spoke to mr . maldinado this morning and it doesn ' t look good . he claims he\
has a connection to the minister of " energy " who will allocate gas to him . i\
asked where would the gas be delivered , and he said anywhere you want it .\
short term or long term ? again , anything you want , but probably long term is\
better .\
i pointed out that there isn ' t an energy minister in saudi and would he know\
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas ? he stumbled and couldn ' t\
remember the name .\
finally he said " what do you have to lose ? just send me a letter requesting\
gas with the specs , location and duration " and he ' ll do his best to get it .\

subject : re : feedback monitor error - meter 984132 - 1 / 99\
i am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details . here are\
my questions :\
1 ) why was this gas just discovered now ? and where has it been hiding ?\
2 ) adonis is a wmbe which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays\
for gas taken . we have to invoice\
the actual burner for this gas ( hl & p , tu , cp & l , etc ) . can we identify end\
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay .\
3 ) adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business . hl & p told me he\
got paid for gas that never was delivered ( rumor ) .\
how can we invoice him now ?\
4 ) 60 , 000 mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks\
for almost two years . answer the above questions and\
i will be glad to approve this .\

sandi ,\
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .\
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated\
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will\
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .\
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the\
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals\
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a\
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to\
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at\
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they\
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do\
you agree with this ?\

Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18\
vance :\
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,\
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .\
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts\
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .\
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads\
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will\
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .\
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells\
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal\
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another\
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced\
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result\
in a financial loss ) .\
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow\
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon\
as i ascertain that date .\
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals\
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that\
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing\
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish\
this .\
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,\

went to you , or your office .\
i would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution\
for the n . padre production . i am certain you are way ahead of me on this\
matter . spinnaker expects a division order title opining within a few\
weeks . i also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which\
will delay a final opinion . in talking with ranger and the houston\
exploration company , they are prepared to receive their gross ( shown below )\
and be responsible to their respective orri owners .\
how do you recommend we proceed ? will hpl pay taxes on behalf of the\
parties ?\

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify\
bob , et al ,\
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in\
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .\
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto\
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the\
end of this month and the beginning of next month .\
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,\
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to\
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could\
continue to have the unify data " cleaned / scrubbed " week to week and try to\
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final\
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just\
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on\
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline\
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month\
would help .\
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to\
have 2 months " active " at a time . in other words , when november is over and\
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain\
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update\
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to\
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in\
the past .\
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to\
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term\
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .\

the above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to ( i guess )\
the meter not being turned off in time . the day prior to each of these days\
that are assessed to strangers gas , the only active k is the hpl 216 .\
can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days ?\
thanks\

Subject: succession plan\
it is my great pleasure to announce that the board has accepted my\
recommendation to appoint jeff skilling as chief executive officer , effective\
at the time of their next board meeting on february 12 , 2001 . jeff will also\
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer . i will continue\
as chairman of the board and will remain at enron , working with jeff on the\
strategic direction of the company and our day - to - day global operations .\
jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all\
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth . he is clearly ready for\
the job , and after 15 years as ceo of this great company , i  , m ready for a\
somewhat different role .\
our succession plan has been clear for some time . this has afforded jeff and\
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that\
continues to exceed everyone  , s expectations , including our own . we look\
forward to furthering that relationship as jeff expands his role .\
there are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad\
shifts in strategy and direction .\
please join me in congratulating jeff . i look forward to a great 2001 .|0

gary :\
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to\
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under\
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the\
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer .\
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated\
to hpl strangers gas contract .\
volume mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from\
someone , but never received one .\
here are the months and volumes that need resolution :\
prod . mth mmbtus\
jan . 99 6 , 510\
feb . 99 6 , 395\

apr . 99 16 , 866\
may . 99 8 , 415\
jun . 99 13 , 858\
total 66 , 833\
possible solution :\
1 . need a deal to cover the periods in question , or\
2 . provide authorization to writeoff the volumes . ( print & return original\
to clem cernosek )\
approval to writeoff the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss\
ps : my understanding is that neither i p petroleum nor pioneer have\
addressed any issues concerning these volumes .|0

fyi\
daren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for\
10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i\
had the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no\
market for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at\
# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up\
with the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .\

Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl\
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for\
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this\
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change\
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200\
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur\
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .\
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the\
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton\
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star\
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being\
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in\
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and\
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not\
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after\
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are\
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy\
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in\
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .|0

Subject: lacy ' s eye exam\
hi bubba !\
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but\
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been\
having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood\
sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have\
stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much\
better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i\
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was\
wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i\
knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a\
child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .\
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let\
him call to tell me about it . i hope he gets his teary eye " fixed " .\
lacy ' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes .\
he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so\
tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she\
smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next\
week . we ' ll talk later about when we are coming to your house . i ' m going to\
longview to a singles retreat sat . in case you call & i ' m not there . will be\
home sat . night . love ya , maw|0

cbs will be forced to discontinue " touched by an angel " for using the word\
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully\
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few\
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the\
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,\
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the\
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .\
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is\
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by\
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all\
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a\
christian can help !\
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their\
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned\
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .\
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in\
our school and in offices across the nation .\
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .\
together we\
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity\
for the lost to know the lord .\

subject : re : deal 819348\
i ' m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk , and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena - im texas ( which i believe no longer exists as part of the post - hpl / aep processes ) to ena - im lonestar . the deals have been split several times anderson , bridgette ; campos , anthony ; gonzales , sharon\

subject : deal 819348\
i was researching deal 819348 ( ces - midcon texas gas services corp ) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 ( in fact , the gtc firm had three deals attached ) . since one of the deals ended 03 / 31 / 01 , we won ' t bother correcting that one , but this deal needs to be moved . i set up contract 96061912 and attached it today . this deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated .\
elizabeth , could you please revalidate this deal ?\

mike ,\
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :\
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149\
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149\
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .\

Subject: northern natural gas\
yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .\
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .\
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .\
ken\
dear ets colleague :\
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .\
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .\
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .\
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .\
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !\

Subject: re : tenaska iv\
ok , since we don ' t appear to be able to hook up by phone . . .\
with respect to ( 1 ) , if ena can ' t effectively manage the plant ' s positions , who can you recommend that could under the same terms ? as you recall , the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset , so the arrangement would probably be short - term at best .\
i think the bank that has collateral rights to the asset will be concerned with the payable . with respect to ( 2 ) , did your discussions with legal lead to any conclusions with respect to compensating the project ? what is the amount of the claim the project has back to ena ? i agree that the project should make payments directly to the suppliers and lone star .\
i ' m around , give me a call if you get a chance .\

subject : tenaska iv\
rick ,\
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .\
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .\
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .\
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .\
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .\

a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29 th and 30 th , a\
total of 660 mmbtu . the problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #\

deal starts for 12 / 99 production . i checked with donald to make sure and\
he says that the meter did start up 11 / 29 and the price is hsc less $ . 10 . in\
order to get this deal into the system , who do i need to talk to ? ? ?\

deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e\
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase\
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i\
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at\
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to\
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this\
gas .\
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not\
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to\
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm\
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the\
producer level .\
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at\
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected\
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest\
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas\

for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not\

backscreen .\
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal\
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a\
subsequent month .\
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co\

i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation\

hear back from daren or julie .\
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back\
w / anita luong and provide her with the k # given to you ( by daren or julie )\
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my\

it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the\

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please\
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk\
scheduler responsible for the cilco account . the biggest variance is in\
january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .\
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the\
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for\
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is\
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .\

this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until\
month ' s end so systematically , no information equals zero . spi , the software\
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file\
transfers , particularly 0 volumes . the only possible solution is to tag all\
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let\
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to\
complete . we may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the\

where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more\
complete data ? we continue to have this problem at various bidirectional\
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality . when mips sends\
pipeline operations a zero prelim , this becomes the best available number and\
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us . when this happens &\
scheduling doesn ' t catch to override the zero , the desk ' s expense is\
understated . this is causing a huge mess for texas operations . what is the\
plan to move this up on measurements priority list ? we need an answer asap ! !\

this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some\
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have\
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the\
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a\
hit when these actual volumes flow through .\
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a\
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .\
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving\
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .\
please give me a call if you have any questions .|0
Subject: re : pg & e texoma volumes\
this particular meter looks okay today , so should not be impacting ua 4 . will\

stephanie ,\
the problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly\
in sitara . for january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas\
from gmt company inc , not gmt inc . someone needs to either correct the deal\
for 1 / 00 or put in a new deal , then i can do an accounting arrangement to\
make the necessary correction . it is correct for 2 / 00 on deal 156292 . i\
emailed daren on this because i see his name in sitara as the contact , but i\
am not sure who actually takes care of it .\

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough\

once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt\

that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate\
transport / gathering agreements , etc . if any rates are changing , then those\
need to be changed in our systems also . there may be other areas of changes\
also - i ' m not attempting to list them all . rather i just want to make\

Subject: ena sales on hpl\
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you\
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for\
which she is looking .\
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &\
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to\
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is\
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .\
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity\
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will\
this give me everything that i need ?\
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in\
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas\
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -\
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?\
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some\
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any\
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !\
thanks in advance .|0

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below\
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will\
have to be put in manually .\
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple\
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,\
enrononline can\
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge\
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently\
cleared out of the monitor .\
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these\
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full\
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes\
weekends . the " wkd " is short for week days . )\
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be\
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into\
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple\
dates for these types of products .\
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824\
thank you .\

subject : 24 x 5 products\
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,\
may 24 th .\
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas\
desk . it will be identified as follows :\
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm\
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in\
that the product description has an\
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day\
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,\
thursday or friday .\
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be\
diligent to identify these products based\
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are\
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -\
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days\
and / or month - ending days ) .\
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these\
transactions and have asked the appropriate\
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider\
building bridge capability . in the\
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,\
and will ask for higher prioritization of the\
bridging in the event that volumes increase .\

i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself\
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll\
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka\
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of\
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the\
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my\
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of\
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to\
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with\
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this\
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for\
data quality and timeliness .\
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .\
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .\
please note the following changes :\
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate\
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not\
necessarily take more time\
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,\
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at\
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .\

Subject: re : wholesale volumes\
texas has a 42 % increase year to year , a 22 % increase qtr . to qtr . and a 30 %\
increase mo . to mo . the yr . to yr . and qtr to qtr increases can be explained\
by an increase in eol transactions and entex taking more gas . the mo . to mo .\
increase is attributable to increase eol transactions and tufco taking more\
gas .\

enron capital meter no . : 6884\
julie ,\
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,\
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts\
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been\
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative\
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara\
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the\
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the\
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara\
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to\
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s\
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master\
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe\
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :\
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450\
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451\

when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?\

subject : hourly gas deals\
here is a high level summary of our discussions last week . i believe that\
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how hpl would like to\
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis .\
option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis .\
bob : please review with the other trading directors and see if they also\
prefer to see everything on a 24 hour flow rate basis . thanks ! - tommy|0

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .\
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,\
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title\
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that\
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .\
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron\
$ . 0025 / transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier .\

fyi -\
it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -\
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .\
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period\
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any\
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please\
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .\
thank you all for your patience and assistance . i appreciate it !\

if you need it , i ' ve got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and\

we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion . in that case ,\
we can use the same transport contract on lone star and transport on other\

on to the plant .\

kathy - - - - - here is what i know about cornhusker :\
our supply comes from apache & williams\
our market typicially is the plant ( tenaska iv partners )\
if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it\
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can\
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or\
not\
daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal\
hope this helps , call with any questions .\

please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you\
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone\
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of\
your favorites .\
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .\
attached is the url for user to run the application .\
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com\
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the\
application .\
here is the steps they should do :\
1 ) launch internet explorer\
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and\
click on above url )\
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if\
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :\
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt\
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names\
into the group .\
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .\
4 ) click on " comments " button to add messages : there will be a popup window\
when user clicks on " comments " button . there are two ways to send the\
messages after typing the\
messages into the text box :\
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or\
( 2 ) click on " send " button to send the message .\
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main\
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message\
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .\
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10\
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will\
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the\
messages .\
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean\
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .\

the case and this was a firm sale , we owe him some gas at dec index less\
( . 045 ) . which is bad ! let me know what happened in dec before i can put\

dear christian friends ,\
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !\
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .\
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .\
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .\
yours in his love and mercy ,\

Subject: re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225\
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm\
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the\
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal\
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will\
expire at the end of this month .\
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &\
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .\
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow\
for evergreen & included something about a " 10 day notification " to\
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to " terminate " this contract .\
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do\
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .\

Subject: jill ,\
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .\
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .\
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .\
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?\
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .\
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .\
hungerford north - where is this ?\
bear den - where is this ?\
moore ' s station - where is this ?\
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .\
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being " good friday " and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .\
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .\
call with any questions\
eric\
work 713 - 345 - 7754\
cell 713 - 412 - 7754\
ps - just a reminder , we are getting the volumes quoted at our preferred liquid point and it will be eex ' s responsibility / burden to get the gas to that point .|0

i ' m still concern about april ' s nom ; if we don ' t take it to zero , than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to barrett ' s april deal . this would be incorrect .\

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .\
let me know is you can ' t .\

get this :\
cbs will be forced to discontinue " touched by an angel " for using the word\
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully\
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few\
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the\
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,\
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the\
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .\
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is\
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by\
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all\
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a\
christian can help !\
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their\
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned\
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .\
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in\
our school and in offices across the nation .\
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .\
together we\
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity\
for the lost to know the lord .\
please press " forward " , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone\
that you think should read this .\
now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after\
you have pressed the " forward " ) .\
don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name .\
please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign\
his / her own name .\
please e - mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this , and help\
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion .\

Subject: re : txu imbalance\
james , thanks for following up on this .\
fyi to all , the agreement we have with el paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal ( as well as external ) communication of the transaction :\
" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . "\
the language stems from a problem we had when east coast power was sold late last year , but probably works to our advantage in this case . suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what ' s coming down the pipe . however , we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible .\

what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .\
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .\

importance : high\
all :\
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .|0

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement\
post - petition expenses\
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .\
pre - petition expenses\
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .\
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .\

we have asked every single counterparty in the nw to sell us energy . we bid $ 300 to powerx and were told that they were abiding by the cap .\

bill ; mike cashell ( mpc ' s transmission mgr . ) just phoned me concerned , because mpc ' s real - time group requested epmi purchase energy for them under our existing energy imbalance structure , and was notified by our real - time group that due to the newly implemented ferc price cap , we were have difficulty securing any resources . just to clarify things , we are settling mpc ' s choice customers energy imbalance position , and pp & l montana has the right to any length resulting from mpc ' s " domestic " load energy imbalance . in other words mpc is settling two separate energy imbalance accounts , so during the hour they may be turning energy back to pp & l montana , while at the same time finding themselves short for the choice loads . during the recent bullish pricing conditions , choice customer were leaving themselves long , as of late , mpc is experiencing the choice customers doing the opposite , positioning themselves short . the net result is that mpc will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on , so i ' d really like to see what we can do to honor their requests , mindful of the favorable position we ' ve enjoyed over the last several months . let me know if you ' d like to discuss this further , or better yet if you ' ve got a workable solution to the problem . in the meantime , thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with mpc . john|0

i attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding . from a real - time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately . i believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well . kourtney nelson is out of the office today but will return on monday . i feel we should involve her in the process when she returns . overall , this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement . feel free to see me with questions .\

Subject: aquilla option and deal entry\
bill ,\
i didn ' t enter the annuity for the aquilla deal as i have a couple more questions on the matter . i ' d like to detail the deal in case you have any questions .\
sold 50 mw to pwrx @ $ 60 he 15 - 18 ( spl 5 )\
covered with ees length and wheel - martel length to leave net short position of 42 , 38 , 35 and 32 respectively\
as the deal clearly turned sour and lowest offer in the 70 ' s , i opted to take the short to the imbalance and hedge the price risk\
he 15 bought 42 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 42 mw vs the " expost settlement price "\
he 16 bought 38 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 38 mw vs the " expost settlement price "\
i found a decent offer for he 17 & 18 ( $ 63 reliant ) so i didn ' t hedge\
expost settled just above $ 90 for both hours and jason will be in on monday to confirm these prices with me\
* i spoke with coral about financial deals as well but travis didn ' t seem to understand which side of the deal he was on as he lowered his fixed offer as a counter .\
i ' ll be in monday to enter the annuity and confirm the price\

Subject: summary - judge ' s recommendation re retroactive refunds\
commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference , the chief judge , in his down home manner , did not miss the opportunity to say that " you can take a horse to water but you can ' t make him drink . " below is a cliff notes version of the judge ' s report and recommendation issued at 4 : 49 pm today . attached is the complete work .\
the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - " while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . " another notable quote : " ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . "\
the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected .\
refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . " spot market " sales are " sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . "\
evidentiary hearing - " the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . "\
methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 .\
heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit .\
gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . " in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the " midpoint " as published in financial times energy ' s " gas daily " publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . "\
o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price .\
emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation .\
credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy .\
ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order .\
maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated .\
offsets - " recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . "\
interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller .|0

Subject: caiso notification : revised draft iso charge matrix and statement\
file specification ( vl 3 . 2 ) - ferc order implementation - to be effective\
trade date june 21 , 2001\
sc settlement contacts :\
important notice\
revised iso charge matrix and\
* emissions and\
* mcp for real time incremental energy .\
the adder raises the mcps , but does not affect the underlying settlement\
formulation . the only change made to the settlement files is the inclusion\
of a new data field for the unadjusted mcp .\
emissions and start - up cost recovery\
the ferc order also directed iso to exclude emissions and start - up fuel\
costs from the calculation of iso ' s mitigated market clearing prices .\
generators can invoice iso for such costs incurred as a direct result of iso\
dispatch actions . iso will implement two new charges :\
* charge type 591 - emissions cost recovery ; and\
* charge type 592 - start - up cost recovery .\
these new charges serve as a mechanism for iso to collect funds which will\
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators ' invoices . a rate will be\
established by iso for each charge . for emissions cost recovery , the rate\
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs ,\
incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of iso dispatch\
instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the emissions cost\
trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state load served by\
the iso ' s transmission system . for start - up cost recovery , the rate will be\
determined similarly . it will equal that of the forecasted annual total of\
all start - up costs , incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of\
iso dispatch instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the\
start - up cost trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state\
load served by the iso ' s transmission system . iso plans to publish these\
rates shortly . the rates may be adjusted monthly based on iso ' s latest\
forecast .\
both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the scheduling\
coordinator ' s settlement statement for the last day of the trade month .\
detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the scheduling coordinator on a\
given day will be provided in the statement for that day .\
implementation timeline\
the credit risk adder and the new emission & start - up cost recovery scheme\
went into effect on trade date 6 / 21 / 2001 . the statements for 6 / 21 will be\
issued on 8 / 15 / 2001 .\
comments & questions\
attached for your review are drafts of the revised charge matrix and\
statement files specification ( version 13 . 2 ) .\

times . if any one sees him ask what is going on . i did try and call brad but\
the number i have for him is no longer in service . i also went over to\
madison high on 58 th and division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was\

Subject: caiso notification - ct 1487 - energy exchange program neutrality\
adjustment\
energy exchange program neutrality adjustment\
charge type 1487\
sc settlement contacts :\
background\
as you may know , the energy exchange program began on trade\
date 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the\
real time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , later\
returned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily a\
one - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutrality\
adjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutrality\
adjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually\
valued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transaction\
that was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 was\
developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market\
during the incoming schedules\
notification\
the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an\
energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurred\
costs will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their total\
negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming\
schedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on the\
june 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . in\
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000\
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the\
rerun data .\
ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that the\
collection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge type\
within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your\
settlement system . note that this charge will not appear on every\
statement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a\
zero balance .\
if you have any questions , please contact your client\
relations account manager .\

Subject: forward obligations report issues\
bill -\
following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this !\
1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw .\
another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours .\
due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible .\
2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before .\
again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . .\
thanks ,\

subject : practice sunday at 11 washington park soccer field\
hi guys ,\
i still have not confirmed anything with the old biddy ' s team so i suggest\
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as i do .\
check out the scrimmage keith found at the washington park soccer field on\
sunday at 11 . he says its open and ok for us to take part . the field is\
close to but south of the rose garden , trolley station and closest too but\
down hill from the kids playground . to get there from the rose garden take\
the road to the left which brings you back into sw portland . hope to see\
you there .\
jon\

subject : re : practice sunday at 1\
hi jake and the rest of you ,\
i went there too ( 33 rd and powell ) and found that no one was there .\
beautiful open field , nets and no one to kick it around with . it does look\
like a good place to practice though and it was open on sunday at 1 . i also\
know that many of you had told me you were not available so i was expecting\
a small turnout but i thought brad ' s team would be there . not sure what\
happened i guess brad ' s team either took the week off , moved , or changed\
times . if any one sees him ask what is going on . i did try and call brad but\
the number i have for him is no longer in service . i also went over to\
madison high on 58 th and division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was\
their either . i will try an sort this out this week and send out another\
e - mail regarding practice . i know justin kerr and adam van loon have\
invited us to come out on thursday night 6 to 8 at oregon episcopal school\
( oes ) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of\
weeks . is that still ok justin or adam ? let us know . sorry about the no\
show practice i ' ll try and sort it out . take care .\

green roomies ,\
we are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the lst division . in first\
division we ' ll have our work cut out for us but i think we ' ll do fine and\
have fun . the first game is sept . 9 th at 12 : 00 with 9 more games each week\
thereafter . i do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon\
as i do . many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the lst division so we need to set a practice schedule . how do tuesday and\
thursday nights look for you guys ? we also need a field we can count\
on . . . . ideas anyone ? in the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness\
in mind . . . running twice a week 4 - 6 miles would be a good start . if we can\
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized i am sure we ' ll be a\
very competitive lst division team . i have been paid by mike z . , kevin ,\
adam , scott , jon b . , mike b . , jay , justin , declan , tristan , and jacob . the\
rest of you still need to mail $ 50 to jon gail 8573 sw dakota drive ,\
tualatin or 97062 if you want to play . again please send me your\
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any\

Subject: a few reminders . . . .\
bill - does this sound reasonable ? do you have anything to add ?\
please make a note of the following . i know we have several new traders , and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process . but this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job . thanks .\
1 . purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book . pay attention when extending deals . if you don ' t purchase the energy in a particular book , you don ' t have energy to sell from that book .\
2 . specify epec as the group when entering deals for el paso .\
3 . el paso model must tie out with carp when trading day is done . check spreadsheet formulas .\
4 . el paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model ( m : / / electric / epe / epeol / augol / epe reconciliation model ) and all variances explained .\
5 . bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $ 15 flat broker fee per trade . if you begin a deal with bloomberg trades , enter a per - megawatt fee , and extend the deal later with bilateral trades , you ' re effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because that fee will be assigned to every mw in your deal . can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn ' t simply multiply $ 15 times the number of bloomberg trades done ? please let me know .\
6 . most importantly , if you are unsure , call someone who is .\
thanks again for your attention to these matters .\

dr . nkem george .\
bank of the north ,\
victoria island branch ,\
lagos , nigeria .\
my dear friend ,\
i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of\
the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria .\
i have an urgent and very profitable business\
proposition for you that should be handled with\
extreme confidentiality .\
on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and\
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum\
corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a\
numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months\
valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred\
united states dollars only ) in my branch .\
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in\
accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding\
address but got no reply .\
after a month we sent a reminder and finally we\
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian\
national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james\
herbert died from an automobile accident .\
on further investigation , we found out that he died\
without making a will and all attempts to trace his\
next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further\
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert\
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all\
his official documents including his bank deposit\
paperwork in my bank .\
this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of\
my bank to a security company in europe for\
safekeeping .\
no one will ever come forward to claim it and\
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and\
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the\
nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the\
fund .\
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front\
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby\
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6\
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security\
company in europe .\
i contacted you because it is against our code of\
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your\
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the\
security company in europe .\
we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum\
would be for you if you agree to take part in this\
profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my\
colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay\
back the expenses that may be incurred during the\
course of the transaction by both parties after the\
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account .\
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the\
transaction , the following information would be needed\
from you to expedite action .\
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to\
establish you as the next of kin of our late client\
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund .\
this would ensure that the security company in europe\
releases the consignment / fund to you .\
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where\
you can be reached at all time because this\
transaction entails constant communication .\
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities\
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of\
the transaction .\
if you are interested , send the requested information\
via email\
i await your response urgently .\
regards ,\
dr . nkem george .\

now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search\
yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review\
of the two systems .\
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,\
both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via\
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca\
adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and\
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .\
the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in\
sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel\
quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more\
channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .\
after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have\
said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and\
are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its\
oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm\
has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored\
comedy ) , and a few more " experimental " music channels which most will find\
totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular\
( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s\
no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you\
buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .\
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are\
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the\
corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying\
in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that\
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up\
loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .\
this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my\
cancelling xm .\
xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent\
music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept\
xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no\
matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered\
everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the\
talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the\
useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .\
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius\
also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .\
however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all\
have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for\
the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where\
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .|1

date : september 21 , 2004 .\
sir ,\
details\
during the regime of president charles taylor in liberia , i was the special adviser to the president on minerals and allied matters . also , i was made the chairman of the presidential task force on sales and exportation of diamonds and other gem stones , which are the major mineral deposits in liberia .\
the above positions availed me the opportunity to divert some fund , which was deposited with a private security vault firm in europe . this i did due to the instability in liberia during the regime of charles taylor , in order to safeguard my future and the future of my entire family .\
you may be aware of the protracted war in liberia . the political uncertainty is very unfriendly . the government of charles taylor , under which i served , had been discredited by the western world , especially the united states who forcefully removed the president and his cabinet and sent them to exile . this is the reason why i am in asylum in the nigeria being a top member of charles taylor? ? ts cabinet .\
thank god , the intention for which i diverted the fund was instantly justified at the inception of a new transition government . all the members of the former regime , including me , were put under probe . our assets were confiscated . all traceable bank accounts , both in liberia and overseas , were frozen , pending the findings of the probe committee or probable pardon by the new regime .\
my only fund that could not be traced is the fund i diverted to the private security vault company in netherlands . the deposit was made in the form of ? ?  concealed lodgment? ?  and the deposit manifest was made as diamonds and family treasures . the only person that is aware of this deposit is my personal lawyer , who i can trust , and you , who i have just told in utmost confidence . please , let it be so and may god help us .\
the amount in question is usd $ 15 million ( fifteen million dollars ) .\
this is the fund i want to invest , through an honest and trusted ally , in any good business in any country outside the continent of africa . this necessitated my search for a competent and reliable person who will oversee the investment on the basis of a joint venture partnership for our mutual benefit . my initial idea was to invest this fund in real estate . but your choice of any other business eitherin your country in any other country other than africa will be appreciated .\
the details of the partnership terms will be drafted by my lawyer on confirmation of your willingness to assist in this venture . also , a meeting could be arranged between you and my lawyer who is based here . this will enable us sign a memorandum of understanding before the fund will be transferred from the security vault company to your custody .\
i look forward to your prompt response as i wish to move this fund out of the vault company due to high cost of deposit contract renewal .\
regards .\

refuse the evil , and choose the good . [ isaiah 7 : 15 ]\
in the great mass of our people there are plenty individuals of intelligence from among whom leadership can be recruited . and now abideth faith , hope and charity , these three , but the greatest of these is charity . [ corinthians ] you have been my friends , replied charlotte , that in itself is a tremendous thing . . .\

focus on competition has always been a formula for mediocrity . objects in pictures should so be arranged as by their very position to tell their own story .\

god cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself , because it is not there . there is no such thing . of toiling , uncheered and alone , that wins us the prizes worth earning , and leads us to goals we would own .\
if you start soon enough , you won ' t have to run to catch up . it is better to be killed than frightened to death .\
i did not attend his funeral but i wrote a nice letter saying i approved of it . [ about a politician who had recently died ]\
there is only one thing harder than looking for a dewdrop in the dew , and that is fishing for a clam in the clam chowder .\
pretense is the overrating of any kind of knowledge we pretend to .\

may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has\
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its\
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which\
includes bermuda .\
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to\
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales\
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration\
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies\
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s\
market as soon as practicably possible .\
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into\
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board\
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .\
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .\
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as\
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross\
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive\
to the caribbean market .\
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the\
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip\
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution\
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the\
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,\
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .\
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent\
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications\
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol\
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone\
service .\
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build\
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers\
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to\
stifle competition .\
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter\
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,\
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the\
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad\
international inc .\
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its\
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though\
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization\
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the\
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the\
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only\
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore\
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .\
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even\
higher .\
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service\
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,\
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace\
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .\
about nomad international inc .\
nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications\
company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over\
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip\
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,\
cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on\
targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in\
effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,\
2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european\
presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in\

and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .\
this results in a faster more powerful effect which still lasts up to 36 hours .\
cialis soft tabs also have less sidebacks ( you can drive or mix alcohol drinks with cialis ) .\

Subject: this was the one recommended to me\
finally !\
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,\
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really\
wants is an extra inch !\
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving\
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it\
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .\
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i\
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original\
size . i was really surprised !\
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence\
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5\
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !\
the lengthening is permanent !\
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it\
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best\
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i\
forget !\
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if\
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your\
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !\
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends\
as new cells grow !\

dear partner ,\
we are a team of government officials that belong to an eight - man committee in the presidential cabinet as well as the senate .\
at the moment , we will be requiring your assistance in a matter that involves investment of monies , which we intend to transfer to your account , upon clarification and a workable agreement reached in consummating the project with you . based on a recommendation from an associate concerning your integrity , loyalty and understanding , we deemed it necessary to contact you accordingly . all arrangements in relation to this investment initiative , as well as the initial capital for its take off has been tactically set aside to commence whatever business you deemed fit , that will turn around profit favourably . we request you immediately contact us if you will be favorably disposed to act as a partner in this venture , and possibly will afford us the opportunity to discuss whatever proposal you may come up with . also\
bear in mind that the initial capital that we shall send across will not exceed $ 13 , 731 , 000 , 00 usd ( thirteen million seven hundred and thirty one thousand united states dollars ) so whatever areas of investment your proposal shall cover , please it should be within the set aside capital . in this regard , the proposal you may wish to discuss with us should be comprehensive enough for our better understanding ; with special emphasis on the following :\
1 . the tax obligationin your country\
2 . the initial capital base required in your proposed\
investment area , as well as ;\
3 . the legal technicalities in setting up a\
business in your country with foreigners as share - holders\
4 . the most convenient and secured mode of receiving the funds without our direct involvement .\
5 . your ability to provide a beneficiary / partnership account with a minimal deposit , where we shall transfer the funds into subsequently .\
another area that we wish to explicitly throw more light on , is the process we have conceived in transferring the funds into the account you shall be providing . since we are the owners of the funds , and the money will be leaving the apex bank of my country , we shall purposefully fulfill the legal obligations precedent to transferring\
such huge amount of funds , without arousing suspicion from any quarter as a drug or terrorist related funds ; and this will assist us in the long run to forestall any form of investigations . remember that , on no account must we be seen or perceived to be directly connected with the transfer of funds . you will be the one to be doing all these , and in the course of transfer , if for any reason whatsoever , you incurred some bills , we shall adequately retire same , upon the successful confirmation of the funds in your account . the commencement of this project is based on your ability to convince us of the need to invest in whatever business you have chosen , and to trust your personality and status , especially as it concerns the security of the\
funds in your custody .\
i await your response ,\
sincerely ,\

Subject: microsoft update warning - january 7 th\
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card\
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on\
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were\
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that\
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .\
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t\
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .\
government spokesman raanan gissin\
said four soldiers were killed .\
six people were taken to hospital - -\
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military\
sources said .\
the sources said another soldier\
remained beneath the rubble .\
gissin said rescue operations were\
continuing sunday night .\
the attack " indicates that unless\
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist\
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards\
political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the\
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "\
shortly after the first blast , a\
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not\
immediately known .\
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said\
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called\
the fatah hawks .\
there was no immediate information\

oil prices continue to explode and ignite the shares of major producers\
which is followed by soaring undervalued otc oi \| plays . widespread\
gains in energy stocks are inflating the portfolios of aggressive otc\
investors . due to recentiy acquired high - potential oi \| and gas projects ,\
eogi is an undervalued gem experiencing a sharp in crease in production\
revenue and becoming a cash - fiow positive leader in major oil - producing\
states .\
eogi ' s high - yieiding , muitiple driiling programs have been solidified\
through valuabie strategic a \| \| iances . these expioration partnerships\
enable the company to accumuiate substantia \| working interests being\
deveioped into a continuously expanding revenue stream . eogi is focused on\
joint - ventures invoiving well re - entry programs in extremely prolific\
production areas using the highest \| evel of technology currently\
avaiiabie .\
recent deveiopments for eogi have been perfectiy timed as al \| 6 dow\

energy stocks outperforming all other market sectors . the company ' s oi \|\
and gas interests in louisiana and texas , in addition to their\
deveioping natural gas wells in aiberta , canada , are continuing to in crease in\
value with energy prices up 60 % from one year ago . leading economists\
and oi \| analysts agree on predictions that a further 3 o - 60 % in crease is\
likeiy next year .\
we are expecting eogi to reiease major news announcements regarding\
production figures on muitipie projects in high - gear . eogi ' s expansion\
plans are on track to acquire additional prospects and properties that can\
oniy add to their growing bottom - line and spark further interest in\
this undervaiued oil play . with a very smal \| float estimated at less than\
5 miilion shares , eogi should gap sharply to the upside on heavy voiume\

Subject: grab this pick flying on sales and earnings kfzx\
market mover stock report ' s last pick ( cwtd ) exploded from $ 1 . 19 to\
$ 9 . 20 , a gain of over 670 % in 5 days ( feb 12 - 17 ) ! ! !\
here is our next hot pick which we feel is the most undervalued stock\
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year based\
on their sales figures ( incl . a backlog of over $ 100 million ) , incredibly solid\
numbers , and low outstanding share total .\
life energy and technology holdings , inc .\
( otcbb : leth )\
current price : 2 . 45\
near - term target : 7 . 00\
projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00\
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the\
most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of\
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !\
sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year\
while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom\
line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating\
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come\
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into\
electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is\
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market .\
( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update :\
leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to\
procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of\
an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months .\
solving a dual crisis - waste and energy :\
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere\
process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of\
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the\
global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process\
converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal\
solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial\
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of\
used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste\
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour\
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid .\
( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news\
leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit\
of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to\
receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per\
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months .\
the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock\
above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry\
pe of 18 - 22 .\
examining leth - by the numbers\
total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets\
cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash\
shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million\
shares retired in feb . ' 04\
additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release\
estimated shares in float : 7 million\
completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26\
record backlog of sales for leth :\
during the past year , over 20 additional biosphere process systems have\
been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over\
$ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements\
include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the\
future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from\
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this\
low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million\
per biosphere process system !\
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :\
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a\
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and\
electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government\
with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of\
necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the\
biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of\
obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the\
biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for\
leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana\
while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -\
term announcement .\
stock set to explode on earnings boom :\
leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to\
achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s\
breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released\
batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully\
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is\
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very\
big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level\
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while\
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global\
demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches\
unprecedented levels .\

Subject: frustration and hopelessness\
dear friend .\
i am hajia mariam abacha the wife of the formal head of state the\
federal republic of nigerian late general sani abacha .\
following the sudden death of my husband general sani abacha the late\
former head of state of nigeria in june 1998 , i have been thrown into a\
state of utter confusion , frustration and hopelessness by the present\
civilian administration , i have been subjected to physical and\
psychological torture by the security agents in the country .\
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . you must have\
heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of\
various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different\
security firms abroad , some companies willingly give up their secrets\
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many out right\
blackmail .\
in fact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the\
tune of $ 700 . million dollars . and they are not relenting to make me poor for life .\
i got your contacts through my personal research , and out of desperation\
decided to reach you . i will give you more information as to this regard\
as soon as you reply . i repose great confidence in you hence my\
approach to you due to security network placed on my day affairs i cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why i decided to contact you and i hope you will not betray my confidence in you . i have deposited the sum of 35 . 3 million dollars ) with a security firm abroad whose name is with held for now until we open communication .\
i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account\
for safe keeping . this arrangement is known to you my lawyer and my son\
mohammed abacha alone who have just been released by the federal government , so my lawyer will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being .\
i am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly\
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that i can start all over again if only you wish , but if it is impossible , just help me in diverting this fund into your account which will accrue you 30 % of this fund . please honesty is the watch word in this transaction .\
i will urgently require for your very private number or cell if any .\
in case you don ' t accept please do not let me out to the security as i\
am giving you this information in total trust and confidence\
i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good\
faith . please expedite action . and do get back to me immediately .\
sincerely yours\
hajia mariam abacha\

Subject: stock pick alert - read the profile nb qpv\
undervalued market report for largest percentage\
gain leaders\
opening price : 2 cents\
immediate target : 10 cents in 10 days\
near - term proj . high : 25 cents\
current market value ( approx ) : 1 . 5 million\
* * our picks are on fire ! * *\
our last pick for huge percentage gains ( gdls ) soared from\
. 23 to . 83 ( 261 % on 3 / 29 ) immediately following our report .\
we believe the gains for aret will run circles around all\
our other picks for the year .\
rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have\
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of\
high - profit based oil and gas reserves ( ticker : aret ) . significant\
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of arete\
industries , inc . are set to explode based on expanded production\
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major\
oil - producing states .\
aret just released major news and we believe there is much more\
to follow . there is strong evidence of big block buying indicating\
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near - term announcement .\
as recently reported , aret is executing the launch of a $ 1 billion\
financed master energy fund which is capped at $ 100 million\
increments to fund the company ' s energy projects . the value of\
these projects has shot - up substantially since initially evaluated\
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb . opec ' s\
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil\
prices will have a far - reaching effect on the bottom line of this\
unknown junior oil - play hardwired for profits .\
aret has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling\
the company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties\
from oil and gas wells in proven fields , with predictable asset\
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the\
greatest near - term financial reward .\
while many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to\
develop , aret ' s financing commitment is smashing down those barriers .\
aret is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil\
and gas producer preparing to announce first - look deals with\
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the\
funding structure will enhance profitability .\
just in :\
aret to develop energy trading platform for oil and gas with major\
international trading company to create substantial corporate revenues\
how many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn ' t get your\
hands on them or didn ' t have the right information in time ? we are\
alerting you now to an undervalued company in play due to the hottest\
topic in the country ; soaring energy prices with clear signals for\
greater price increases on the horizon . frenzied block buying will\
dominate trading as aret has a market value under $ 2 million which\
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value\
of their oil and gas deals are revealed .\

special alert : ( otcbb : ipys ) - - 200 % gains expected\
this urgent investor bulletin has been sent out to our millions of subscribers immediately to allow investors the opportunity to accumulate a substantial position in this great stock . instapay systems , inc . . ( otcbb : ipys ) is the latest new pick , set to really move in near future . this company deserves your immediate attention . stock mule team found a new winner yet again !\
instapay systems , inc . , ( otcbb : ipys )\
current price : $ 0 . 40\
short term target : $ 1 . 20\
short term gain ; 300 %\
instapay systems highlights\
no competition - ipys is the first and only transaction processing production system to enable internet merchants to accept atm card ( " pin " debit ) payments - this is a multibillion market currently , and the fastest growing segment of the transaction processing industry . online credit card and electronic check purchases totaled more than $ 90 billion in the us in 2003 .\
merchants pay only a fixed fee per transaction for pin debit transactions , as opposed to the way credlt card transactions are currently processed , as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transactions . merchants will save billions in transaction processing fees paid to visa , mc and other credit card companies .\
ipys developed the encrypted processing system enabling the use of atm cards over the internet and owns the patents to it as well as the gateway service for delivering this service over the internet .\
the company has already identified several major credit card transaction processing providers that are violating the company ' s patent and ipys is filing several civil law suits to collect the tens of millions due the company by some of the biggest names in the processing business .\
many large chain store merchants are opting to lower their electronic transaction processing costs by offering pin debit payment solutions to customers . in february 2004 wal - mart ( nyse : wmt ) began refusing mastercard signature debit cards and requires customers to enter their pin number , saving the chain tens of millions annually . ipys owns the patents to this process that walmart ' s processors are using .\
ebay ( nasdaq : ebay ) acquisition of paypal for 1 . 5 billion tied them into direct debit processing for ebay purchases this year . direct debit processing is expected to account for 45 % of all transactions by 2005 . ipys patents will allow the company to literally own this market .\
the stock mule team can ' t predict a long term target for ipys because no one knows what will happen when ipys signs its next several large nationally based chain stores to its transactions processing system . this stock could skyrocket to $ 10 . 00 overnight ; and then explode beyond our wildest dreams ! thank you for your trust and keep the faith the stock mule team\

a monthly magazine exterior for boys . each issue containsdiachronic several feature stories - - includes a current events column , games and puzzles . adventures set in a variety of historical periods and locales - - that continue over three to four months . stories are copiously illustrated with half - page and full - page engravings in addition to the cover illustration . miscellaneous material at the back of each issue . imagine life without telephones , tvs , computers , x - rays , lasers , and the internet . as diverse as they may seen , all these technologies , and many others , have one thing in common - they all use electricity and magnetism . for hundreds of years , engineers have been finding new ways of using electricity to revolutionize the way we work , play , learn , and communicate . at this site by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers you will explore the history of these technologies , find out how they work , and learn about some of the people who invented them . tonight is what many consider the biggest night ofor the school year - prom night . and with more than one covington county school celebrating tonight , the roadways are guaranteed to be a little more congested than a typical thursday night . covington county citizens have a unique opportunity tonight to sample a little wildlife - or wild food if you will when the alabama wildlife federation presents its annual wild game cook off at the covington center arena in andalusia at 5 p . m . andalusia ace tyler wilson was on and the beauregard hornets were not as the bulldogs recorded an 8 - 0 win in the first round of the state baseball playoffs wednesday . and on this most holy of weekends , we should rest in the comfort that their is hope and peace that is found in time of sorrow . and if the pain becomes too much to bear for the friends , family and acquaintances of these two fine young men - then we implore them to seek out the help of others - others who can offer those words of kindness and comfort . how is this different than the star - news web site ? our web site is full of valuable carpet information , but it does not contain all the stories in each day ' s paper . web visitors miss engagement announcements , wedding news , social news , religious columns , full - length obituaries , photos and more . the digital download star - news is the exact same file used to make our printing plates , only smaller and with some non - electronic ads removed . the recent proposal to the covington county commission is nothing more than an attempt to limit the rights of those who wish to hunt with the use of dogs . many of the actions of dog hunters as well as those who oppose dog hunting are regrettable and disgusting . the truth is i could fill this article with instances where a dog hunter did something hurtful to a landowner . i could also cite many instances where stalk hunters have done things they shouldn ' t have done . i have even been encouraged to attack the character of those with an opposing view but i want to steer clear of that sort of emotional grandstanding and simply present some facts . the bushe administration is moving to change a postwar cancerous policy that blocked members of saddam hussein ' s baath party from iraqi government and military positions . civilian administrator paul bremer , who put the ban in place , now wants to change the policy as part of an effort to convince sunnis , who dominate the party , that they are welcome in the postwar political transition . an official with south korea ' s defense ministry confirmed thursday that a large explosion occurred near ryongchon station , causing an unknown number of deaths , yonhap news agency reported . two trains carrying flammable materials have exploded in a north korean train station , leaving a large number of casualties , south korean media reports . eight people died in the collapse of the milestonetavern when a tornado destroyed large parts of the town of utica , illinois . survivor jeremy thorson tells the tale of how he left the tavern just before the tornado hit on tuesday night .\
where your are determines what grows inside of you . the best way to distract a man with a goal is to give him another one . those who unlock your compassion are those who have been assigned . losers discuss what that are going through . champions discuss what they are going to do .\

many years ago , on my way from hong kong to new york , i passed a\
week in san francisco . a long time had gone by since i had been in\
that city , during which my ventures in the orient had prospered\
beyond my hope ; i was rich and could afford to revisit my own\
country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of\
my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old\
affection . chief of these , i hoped , was mohun dampier ,\
an old schoolmate with whom i had held a desultory\
correspondence which had long ceased , as is the way\
of correspondence between men . you may have observed\
that the indisposition to write a merely social letter\
is in the ratio of the square of the distance between\
you and your correspondent . it is a law . i remembered\
dampier as a handsome , strong young fellow of scholarly\
tastes , with an aversion to work and a marked\
indifference to many of the things that the world\
cares for , including wealth , of which , however ,\
he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach\
of want . in his family , one of the oldest and most\
aristocratic in the country , it was , i think , a matter\
of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor\
politics , nor suffered any kind of distinction . mohan was\
a trifle sentimental , and had in him a singular\
element of superstition , which led him to the study\
of all manner of occult subjects , although his sane\
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and\
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm\
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in\
the partly surveyed and charted region of what\
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of\
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter\
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the\
deserted streets , or , lifted by irregular gusts\
of wind , was hurled against the houses with incredible\
fury . with no small difficulty my cabman found the\
right place , away out toward the ocean beach ,\
in a sparsely populated suburb . the dwelling ,\
a rather ugly one , apparently , stood in the\
centre of its grounds , which as nearly as i could\
make out in the gloom were destitute of either\
flowers or grass . three or four trees , writhing\
and moaning in the torment of the tempest , appeared\
to be trying to escape from their dismal\
environment and take the chance of finding\
a better one out at sea . the house was a\
two - story brick structure with a tower , a\
story higher , at one corner . in a window\
of that was the only visible light .\
something in the appearance of the\
place made me shudder , a performance\
that may have been assisted by a rill\
of rainwater down my back as i scuttled\
to cover in the doorway . in answer to\
my note apprising him of my wish to call ,\
dampier had written , ' don ' t ring -\
open the door and come up . ' i did\
so . the staircase was dimly lighted\
by a single gas - jet at the top of the\
second flight . i managed to reach the\
landing without disaster and entered by an\
open door into the lighted square room of\
the tower . dampier came forward in gown and\
slippers to receive me , giving me the greeting\
that i wished , and if i had held a thought\
that it might more fitly have been accorded me\
at the front door the first look at him dispelled\
any sense of his inhospitality . he was\
not the same . hardly past middle age , he\
had gone grey and had acquired a pronounced\
stoop . his figure was thin and angular , his face\
deeply lined , his complexion dead - white ,\
without a touch of colour . his eyes ,\
unnaturally , glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny .\
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and\
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm\
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in\
the partly surveyed and charted region of what\
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of\
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter\
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the\
deserted streets , or , lifted by irregular gusts\
of wind , was hurled against the houses with incredible\
fury . with no small difficulty my cabman found the\

upgraded to outperform : arme\
armor enterprises , inc ( otc bb : arme )\
current price : $ 0 . 87\
90 day target : $ 1 . 80\
12 month target : $ 5 . 00\
shares out : 37 . 7 million\
market capitalization : $ 27 . 9 million\
- arme is a leader in the design , development , and manufacture of " clean energy " electrical battery power drive systems for land and marine vehicles . the company ' s proprietary lithium - ion electric battery system provides highly efficient and environmentally clean power capable of driving a vehicle at high speeds . arme plans to begin marketing and distribution of a wide range of electric vehicles utilizing these proprietary drive technologies , and will introduce lines of electric bicycles , motor scooters , atv ' s , and other vehicles from late fiscal 2004 .\
- with manufacturing and distribution channels already in place for major markets in europe , asia , and the americas , we believe that arme is well positioned to emerge as a major player in an explosive growth $ 16 . 2 billion electric vehicle market that is expected to reach $ 177 billion by 2013 .\
1 . armor enterprises is continuing to enhance its product line with new electric vehicles and innovative technologies . the company has recently acquired the rights to produce and install the newest , high tech gas turbine fired generator on all its electric vehicles as a modular component . inclusion of this system will further enhance armor enterprises competitive advantage , enabling its electric vehicles to safely recharge their batteries on board with low pressure hydrogen running a turbine generator - effectively eliminating the need for recharging the vehicle ' s battery while providing additional power . armor enterprises is further working to broaden its planned product offering with the development of new vehicle systems for its technologies . most notably , the company has recently entered into an agreement with nova communications , manufacturer of a line of innovative personal water craft , for joint development of a marine propulsion engine .\
2 . the company benefits from its strong and experienced management team , board of directors , and advisory board , who have extensive experiences in the alternative energy and electric vehicle industries , and who have a history of successful tenures at public and private companies . president and ceo merrill moses is an experienced executive and investment banker , and vp of operations ms . cheryl spousta - schertzer has extensive senior management experiences in the telecommunications and high tech industries . the company also benefits from having an active board of directors and advisory board , who have been involved in the development of alternative energy and electric vehicle technologies for nearly twenty years .\
3 . armor enterprises is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of a rapidly growing $ 16 . 2 billion electric vehicle industry that is expected to reach revenues of $ 177 billion by 2013 ! driven by improvements in ev storage and drive technologies , increasing government incentives and regulations , and ongoing concerns about the environmental and economic impact of reliance on fossil fuels , the electric vehicle industry has rapidly grown from little more than a curiosity to a multi - billion dollar global business . in the us alone , the ev industry is growing at a cagr of 27 % and is expected to reach industry revenues of more than $ 7 billion by 2005 . with its focus on lucrative , mature , and high growth niche markets within the ev industry , including motor scooters ( a $ 2 . 5 billion market in europe alone ) , off highway motorcycles and atv ' s ( $ 20 billion ) , and personal water craft ( $ 1 . 4 billion ) , we believe that armor enterprises has significant competitive advantages and early - mover status within this niche markets .\
4 . armor enterprises has received significant interest in its line of electric vehicles from major distributors and is currently in the testing phase for a number of potential major contract wins . the company has announced a number of significant negotiations with major groups in europe , asia , and the americas for purchase and distribution of armor ' s line of ev products , and we anticipate that delivery of prototype models and testing will serve to validate its offering , leading to major contract and distribution agreements over the next six months . the company has recently undertaken a contract to build and deliver prototypes for its electric mountain bike , electric arv , electric go - kart , and neighborhood electric vehicle ( nev ) to be used as demonstration models for a very large private company . armor enterprises has further undertaken negotiations with one of the largest go - kart race track consortiums in europe to provide models of their electric go - karts for testing . we believe that these and other testing developments will facilitate the development of widescale distribution and sales efforts from late 2004 .\
5 . the company derives significant advantages from its established strategic relationship with one of asia ' s largest two wheel vehicle manufacturers , which will prove an invaluable assistance in rapidly ramping up production , building distribution channels , and developing new product lines . strategic alliances and joint ventures are an integral component in the company ' s business strategy , enabling armor to focus its efforts , capital , and resources on core competencies while leveraging the strategic partner ' s expertise in manufacturing and distribution . the strategic relationship with one of the largest two wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the world will provide armor with access to affordable , scalable , and high quality manufacturing and a global network of distributors . this relationship will be provide major impetus for the company ' s near - term revenue and sales growth , and enable the company to meet aggressive sales targets without the capital expenditure normally associated with product development and manufacturing .\
armor enterprises , inc . ( otc bb : arme ) is a rapidly expanding provider of land and marine electric vehicles ( ev ) utilizing its proprietary lithium - ion battery storage and drive technologies . the company ' s innovative electric battery power drive system can be easily utilized on a wide range of vehicles including scooters , mopeds , atv ' s , go - karts , and water craft , offering tremendous improvements in range and speed over competitive electric battery products with significantly improved recharge times . armor has also recently acquired licensing rights to an innovative low pressure hydrogen turbine technology which will enable its ev ' s to safely generate battery power onboard while providing additional engine power . we believe that armor enterprises ' product line of electric vehicles are superior in quality , performance , and cost to competitors and further distinguish the company as a leader in the electric vehicle industry .\
we think that arme is an investment opportunity that cannot be missed , and strongly urge you to take advantage of the current pricing levels to buy now and see huge short term profits . with introduction of its line of innovative electric vehicles scheduled to begin in late 2004 , arme is poised to see major revenues this year ! ! ! with revenues of over $ 50 million expected for fy 2005 , we believe that arme presents a perfect opportunity to invest on the ground floor of the electric vehicle boom . we believe that arme will see appreciation to levels of approximately $ 5 . 00 per share within the next twelve months , and the stock could reach $ 1 . 50 within the next seven trading days ! !\

there are thousands hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root .\
i must say , i don ' t feel very qualified to be a pop star . i feel very awkward at times in the role .\
when the stomach is full , it is easy to talk of fasting .\
i know not what course others may take but as for me , give me liberty , or give me death .\
he who would acquire fame must not show himself afraid of censure . the dread of censure is the death of genius .\
classic art was the art of necessity : modern romantic art bears the stamp of caprice and chance .\
he also who is slack in his work is brother to him who destroys . [ proverbs 18 : 9 ]\
perhaps in a book review it is not out of place to note that the safety of the state depends on cultivating the imagination .\
these can never be true friends : hope , dice , a prostitute , a robber , a cheat , a goldsmith , a monkey , a doctor , a distiller .\
we seem , as it were , to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind .\
how easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly !\
the folly of all follies is to be love sick for a shadow .\
every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying .\
the art of creation is older than the art of killing .\
fortune makes a fool of those she favors too much .\
nobody speaks the truth when there ' s something they must have .\
desire is proof of the availability . . .\
joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside .\
an aged man is but a paltry thing , a tattered coat upon a stick\

Subject: compliments of the season\
a very good day to you\
i am mr . jonathan mwari zuma , an accountant and principal overseer\
with the south african mining corporation . i got your contact through\
my local chamber of commerce with the help of a friend in line with\
the search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very\
confidential transaction , which involves transfer of fund to a\
foreign account . this said fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) twenty million , five\
hundred thousand united states dollars , is a variation and\
accumulation of equity investment made in the south african mining\
corporation in the period of 1983 - 1987 . this redeemable investment\
interest , has now matured and has long been cleared for disbursement\
but with no apparent knowledge of who the investors are as most of the\
investors then , were corrupt government officials and their cronies\
under the obnoxious apartheid regime who used pseudo names and aliases\
in the transactions , and could not come up for claims under the\
present political setting in south africa .\
after due consultative sessions with my colleagues in the account\
department of the mining corporation over the fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) , which\
is now considered as floating fund , we decided to confiscate the fund\
and placed it in a private trust company for safe keeping , awaiting\
further transfer to a foreign account for further business ventures .\
what we need now is a foreign national who can assist us in the\
transfer of this fund , and also to help invest the fund in a risk free\
venture . if you are willing to assist us in this transfer , we have\
agreed to compensate you with a certain percentage ( 15 % ) of the total\
sum ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) through mutual negotiations . your specialty is not a\
barrier to this transaction as we have mapped out strategies to\
effectively actualize this transaction .\
thank you for your anticipated co - operation , and we hope to hear from\
you soon , to enable us give you full details of the transactions .\
alternatively , you can reply using this email below\
on the contrary , do let me know that you can not transact this\
business .\
best regards\

frontier oil and gas otc : fogl\
current price : $ 0 . 07\
possibilty of huge day monday and all of next week as large pr\
campaign kicks off this weekend and is expected to last all of next\
week .\
imagine how well your portfolio would have done last month if you\
had the scoop on the following oil and gas stock :\
( otcbb : fdei ) : this oil and gas deal closed at $ . 47 on september lst .\
it traded over $ 1 on october lst , a more than 100 % move in\
approximately one month . . you may not know a lot about investing ,\
but we ' re sure you can count .\
with oil hovering around $ 50 a barrel , select small oil and gas\
stocks could continue to get increased investor attention moving\
forward .\
let ' s look at today ' s featured company , frontier oil and gas ( otc :\
fogl )\
frontier oil and gas ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and\
gas production company . this company through a 50 / 50 joint venture\
with fowlers oil and gas will be penetrating the market in the\
business of natural gas and oil production .\
the vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid\
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a\
balance of short and long term reserves for both natural gas and\
oil . the company will establish this through strategic development\
partnerships and independently in the future . the company will work\
to establish and maintain properties with potential for development\
and drilling . the company emphasize will be on production , cash flow\
and reserve value .\
fowler project\
frontier oil and gas brings excellent partners to the table in\
fowlers oil and gas . the company is looking to develop both oil and\
natural gas reserves located in the cook inlet oil basin in alaska .\
ownership of the 80 acres property located in the cook inlet is\
owned free and clear by the fowler family for the last 45 years ,\
with an additional 7 , 000 adjacent acres to be leased . well spacing\
for the owned property will be one ( 1 ) well for every twenty ( 20 )\
acres with the possibility of approval for a one ( 1 ) well per ten ( 10 )\
acres . current oil reserve is an unproven reserve with an estimated\
2 billion barrels . current gas reserve is a fully documented reserve\
with an estimated 1 . 9 trillion cubic feet . the development property\
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .\
corporate vision\
frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in\
an ever - growing share of the oil and gas marketplace . frontier has\
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set goals\
and believes that there are several key factors that will make\
frontier successful .\
1 ) the fowler project is lower risk then most oil and gas ventures\
due to the following :\
the gas field is a proven reserve for cook inlet .\
our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .\
capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will\
be internally generated by the gas revenue , and the ability to sell\
oil futures for physical delivery in 2 - 3 years .\

it is too late . like many of these stocks , it may move quickly and\
timing is critical . good luck and successful trading !\

Subject: why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez .\
how i stole your election\
by george w . bush\
the first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude !\
next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress .\
did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate .\
so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state .\
then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) .\
here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ?\
look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again .\
and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! !\
http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org /\
i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! !\

humanitarian assistance is being moved into the town .\
about 25 to 30 injured civilians in the city have\

forces have died in the falluja offensive .\
about 1 , 200 insurgents have been killed in the\
battle , he said .\
although falluja is secured , troops remain busy\
conducting mopping up operations and engaging in sporadic fights with holdout\
insurgents in the city .\
sattler said u . s . and iraqi troops are " ubiquitous "\
throughout the city .\
" falluja is secure , but we ' re in that\
search - and - clear phase which will make it safe , " he said .\
" we ' ve commenced the clean - up operation " and\
humanitarian assistance is being moved into the town .\
about 25 to 30 injured civilians in the city have\
been treated for injuries , sattler said , adding that he knows of no civilians\
killed in the fighting .\
he said more than 1 , 000 suspects have been\
captured . some have been released after questioning .\
thair al - nakib , a spokesman for interim iraqi prime\
minister ayad allawi , said the battle for falluja has been won by u . s . and iraqi\

and a very good morning to you ! : )\
tot ziens\
to me , fair friend , you never can be old . for as you were when first your eye i eyed . such seems your beauty still . fear of change perplexes monarchs .\
if your energy is as boundless as your ambition , total commitment may be a way of life you should seriously consider .\
a man of knowledge lives by acting , not by thinking about acting . there is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory , but boys it is all hell .\
the white man knows how to make everything , but he does not know how to distribute it .\
those who play with the devil ' s toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword .\
books give not wisdom where none was before . but where some is , there reading makes it more .\
prithee don ' t screw your wit beyond the compass of good manners .\
one may go a long way after one is tired .\
if you want to be a winner , hang around with winners\
the display of grief makes more demands than grief itself . how few men are sad in their own company .\
a person dishonored is worst than dead . the pencil of the holy ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of job than the felicities of solomon .\
skillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness , loquaciousness , and laryngitis . the bastard ! he doesn ' t exist !\
always remember , a cat looks down on man , a dog looks up to man , but a pig will look man right in the eye and see his equal . the wise does at once what the fool does at last .\

gilford , n . h . , 2004 / prnewswire - firstcall via comtex / - - istorage networks , inc . ( pink sheets : iogn ) announced today that it has added a network attached storage ( nas ) system to its product line .\
nas is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network ' s workstation users . by removing storage access and its management from the department server , both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources .\
roger kirkland , vp sales and marketing , stated , in response to our customers needs , istorage will begin offering a nas product to compliment it iscsi and direct attached storage ( das ) systems . the small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their it infrastructure . istorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network .\
the istorage nas solution will be offered at an msrp of under $ 5 , 000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005 .\

Subject: microsoft update warning - january lst\
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card\
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on\
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were\
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that\
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .\
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t\
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .\
government spokesman raanan gissin\
said four soldiers were killed .\
six people were taken to hospital - -\
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military\
sources said .\
the sources said another soldier\
remained beneath the rubble .\
gissin said rescue operations were\
continuing sunday night .\
the attack " indicates that unless\
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist\
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards\
political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the\
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "\
shortly after the first blast , a\
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not\
immediately known .\
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said\
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called\
the fatah hawks .\
there was no immediate information\
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah\
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .\
israeli military sources said it was\
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the\
post when the explosives were detonated .\
it was not clear whether there were\
palestinian casualties .\
news video of the aftermath showed\
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely\
wounded .\
in a pamphlet distributed after the\
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of\
the incident .\
palestinians have used tunnels in the\
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack\
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard\
an israeli tank shell exploded in a\
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,\
palestinian medical and security sources said .\
the children between the ages of 6\
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .\
the violence happened in khan yunis\
in central gaza\
israeli military sources said that\
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells\
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .\
in response , the forces fired towards\
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military\
sources said .|1

recent news and major share - price driving milestones :\
geec just announced a lo bi \| \| ion , 5 - year joint venture with several\
companies operated by the chinese government .\
geec uses their biosphere process system to convert various types of\
waste into ciean , green eiectricity at 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour .\
geec chairman , former prime minister of ireland dr . albert reynoids ,\
has secured a 2 bi \| \| ion lineofcredit for geec and opened doors in over\
a\
dozen countries through poiitica \| contacts at the highest level .\
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj diversified\

conservative estimates vaiue the company at one biliion .\
solving a dua \| crisis - waste and energy\
geec is utiiizing the unique proprietary technoiogy of their biosphere\
process system for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at\
5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the giobal waste\
problem . this profitable and environmenta \| \| y safe process converts into\
clean ,\
green eiectricity such waste materials as municipal soiid waste ,\
agricuitural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial\
wastes ,\
sewage siudge , shale oil , sour natura \| gas , and the huge market of used\
tires .\
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of eiectricity from the\
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish\
the\
\| oca \| or nationa \| grid .\
china ' s aggressive pursuit of geec makes 20 o 5 a blue - chip year\

exceeding 1 . 3 biliion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance\

blackouts in al \| chinese provinces . geec is in \| ine to gain\
substantia \| \| y\
while providing reiief from unmanageable municpa \| solid waste disposal\
and simultaneously heiping china meet its energy needs .\
future miiestones :\
1 . geec had a loo miliion backlog of saies orders for the biosphere\
before the china joint - venture with 26 completed biospheres in\
operation .\
the backiog is now into the billions with complete financing to be\
provided by china and 1 , 30 o biospheres to be depioyed throughout the\
country .\
2 . geec ' s present assets of 35 miliion wi \| \| conservatively jump into\
the 300 miliion range , a lo - times increasee .\
3 . geec is in advanced stages of agreement on at least 6 major\
international projects which couid add 5 o miliion to the bottom - line or\
1 . 42\

4 . p / e on average for this industry group is 20 to 1 putting geec above\

the vaiue of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :\
1 . price charts confirm oi \| prices are experiencing the strongest buil\
market in a generation .\
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the \| ast two years .\
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on\
reserves worth muiti - millions , eogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the\
value of its assets .\
4 . emerson oil and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn\
unproductive oi \| and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .\
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the\
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry\
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized\
explorers and developers \| ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are\
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and\
even quadrupie returns .\
our subscribers need to pay particulariy ciose attention to undervaiued\
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this sma \| \| company\
with a comparabiy smal \| market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil\
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with\
the daiiy jump in energy prices .\
but all that wil \| change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move\
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to\
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive\
effect on\
the share price .\
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson\
oi \| and gas ' shares ? wel \| we do know this - the great thing about\
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases\
in\
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline\
siightiy , you wil \| stil \| make a very heaithy return . of course , energy\
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year\
or\
so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings wiil\
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wil \| be\
staggering .\
overa \| \| , we consider eogi to be one of the \| ast outstanding energy\
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,\
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have\
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oi \| and\
gas\
reserves are weil estabiished and are going into massive production .\
early\
investors will secure optimum gains , and any additional news in this\

salimibrah @ netscape . net\
dear friend ,\
my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in\
the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer\
it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and\
right now i have only about a few months to live ,\
according to medical experts .\
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i\
never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my\
business . though i am very rich , i was never generous ,\
i was always hostile to people and only focused on my\
business as that was the only thing i cared for . but\
now i regret all this as i now know that there is more\
to life than just wanting to have\
or make all the money in the world .\
i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to\
this world i would live my life a different way from\
how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i\
have willed and given most of my property and assets\
to my immediate and extended family members as well as\
a few close friends .\
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so ,\
i have decided to give also to charity\
organizations , as i want this to be one of the last\
good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed\
money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e ,\
algeria and malaysia . now that my health has\
deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself\
anymore .\
i once asked members of my family to close\
one of my accounts and distribute the money which i\
have there to charity organization in bulgaria and\
pakistan , they refused and kept the money to\
themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as\
they seem not to be contended with what i have left\
for them .\
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge\
cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred thousand u . sdollars )\
that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want\
you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity\
organizations .\
i have set aside 15 % for you .\
god be with you .\
salim ibrahim\
note : please do get back to me via my private email address at\
salimibrah @ netscape . net\
becuase i do not want my family to know anything about this\
project , so i could give you the full details about the funds .\
please endeavour to get back to me via my specified private\
email address . salimibrah @ netscape . net\
thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah bless you\
abondantly .\

Subject: hello\
patrick ojo\
universal trust bank nigeria limited ,\
victoria island branch ,\
lagos , nigeria .\
attn : md / ceo\
i am patrick ojo , branch manager with universal trust bank nigeria\
limited , victoria\
island branch , lagos , nigeria .\
i have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that\
should be handled with extreme confidentiality .\
on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant and contractor in nigeria\
mr . james herbert by name made a numbered\
time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 15 . 5 m\
( fifteen\
million , five hundred united states dollars only ) in my branch .\
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in accordance with the\
bank\
policy\
to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a\
reminder\
and finally we\
discovered from his contract employers in nigeria\
that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident .\
on further investigation , we found out that ! he died without making a\
will and\
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made\
further\
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare\
any\
next\
of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank\
deposit\
paperwork in my bank .\
this sum of us $ 15 . 5 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a\
security\
company in europe for safekeeping . no one will ever come forward to\
claim it\
and according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 years the money\
will revert\
to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim\
the fund .\
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you as the next\
of\
kin\
of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum\
of $ 38 . 6\
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security company in europe .\
i contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own ! and\
operate\
foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the\
money\
in the\
security company in europe .\
we have unanimously agreed that 40 % of the entire sum would be for you\
if you\
agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 50 % for me and 2 of\
my\
colleagues\
while the remaining 10 % would be used to pay back the expenses that\
may\
be incurred\
during the\
course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been\
claimed and\
lodged in your account .\
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction , the\
following\
information would be needed from you to expedite action .\
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as\
the\
next\
of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of\
the fund .\
this would ensure that the security company in europe releases the\
consignment / fund\
to you .\
2 ) your private mobile , telp ! hone and fax numbers where you can be\
reached\
at\
all time because this transaction entails constant communication .\
3 ) your full banking information .\
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected\
to ensure\
the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested , send\
the requested\
information via email\
i await your response urgently .\
regards ,\
patrick ojo\

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .\
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april\
17 th\
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after\
taking the first 2 pills ,\
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i\
turned 35 years old .\
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital\
for 9 days i walked\
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year\
till he died of lung\
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste\
away .\
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be\
dead and gone .\
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i\
have been in years .\
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have\
changed my life forever\
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie\
davenport oklahoma city , ok\
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew\
cigarettes were packed\
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there\
were !\
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a\
cigarette ,\
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3\
puffs .\
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !\
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying\
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun\
with no results .\
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e .\

of buying a new car just to owe 2 more years worth of payments when you\
wish you could just give it back and get a new one ? well guess what you\
can ! you should think about leasing .\

to exoticwe lease any make or model\
vehicle . we can get the brand new vehicle you want at the lowest possible\
price from any dealer because we are facillitators .\
hassle free\
i can work with you in person or over the phone . we can do the\
paperwork through the mail so you never have to leave your home . we can\
deliver your new vehicle to your door .\
worry free\
with leasing there is no worry of being " upside down " because you\
only pay for the car until your term is up then you have the option to\
turn it in and walk away or you can buy it out if really want to keep it .\
pressure free\
buying a car from a dealer can be such a headache , playing all the\
games to get the best price and all the pushing to get you to buy the car\
they want to sell not the car you want . then it ends up being worth way\
less than what you owe on it when a couple years down the road you want a\
new one . don ' t get caught in the endless loop of ownership .\
let me help you drive the car of your choice . give\
me a call or click the link below to fill out our secure finance\
application and get you out of the endless loop .\

mr . joshua nkosi ,\
absa bank limited ,\
johannesburg , south africa .\
dear sir ,\
i am mr . joshua nkosi , manager of bills / exchange at the\
foreign remittance department of absa bank . in my department , we\
discovered an abandoned sum of us $ 14 , 700 , 000 . 00 ( fourteen million , seven hundred thousand united state dollars only ) in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family , on november\
1996 , in a ghastly plane crash , and he happened to be a foreigner . since we got the information about his death , we have been expecting his next - of - kin to come over and claim his money\
because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our\
banking guidelines . unfortunately , nobody has come forward to claim this money .\
it is based on this that some officials in my department and i have decided to establish a cordial business relationship\
with you , hence by contacting you . we want you to present yourself as the next of kin through your relation with the deceased , so that the funds can be remitted into your account .\
moreover , we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills . the banking law and guidelines here\
stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years , is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account .\
now , it is being speculated that the above sum will be\
transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarterof 2005 , when nobody come forward to lay claims . the reason for requesting you to\
present yourself as next of kin , is occasioned by , the fact that the deceased ( customer ) was a foreigner , and we have\
access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin .\
the mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account , shall be 70 % to my colleagues and i , for the\
role you will be expected to play in this deal , we have agreed to give you 25 % of the total sum and 5 % for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction . therefore , you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business . after receiving your reply , you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take .\
i expect your urgent response through my email address : joshuakosi @ maktoob . com . and i shall contact you for further discussion on this matter , to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch .\
please treat this business proposal as strictly\
confidential for security reasons considering my official position in absa bank .\
personal regards ,\
mr . joshua nkosi .\

the number of\
uninsured is predicted to increase to 53 million by 2010\
a sneak preview of a undiscovered company that is\
poised to explode with the answers\
this is your chance to be a sneak .\
yes a sneak . . . . this is your chance\
to sneak into the market before the big boys pick up on this newly\
featured company otc : ephm a undiscovered company that is\
poised to explode .\
the street has not yet picked up on otc :\
ephm yet , but we are certain that they will . . . .\
all of us see offers on companies for us to\
buy into that claim to be the next big winner of the year , making claims that\
you will make 200 % - 400 % in a matter of days or weeks on your money , this simply does not happen . . . . most\
of the time\
we are not going to tell you in the case of\
otc : ephm that you\
are will earn 200 % - 400 % in a day or a week , however epipharma presents a\
fantastic opportunity for all of our readers to sneak into the market and get\
the edge on this one well ahead of the big boys .\
recent press\
epipharma and strategic healthcare systems sign letter of\
intent to merge\
scottsdale , ariz . - - ( business wire ) - - aug . 8 , 2005 - - epipharma , inc .\
( epipharma ) ( otc : ephm ) has signed a letter of intent to merge with strategic\
healthcare systems , inc . ( shs ) , a healthcare management company that manages and\
operates quality healthcare clinics in predominantly urban areas of california .\
shs is a healthcare management company founded in 1996 by dr . albert a . gomez\
to provide solutions to uninsured americans and change the way in which\
healthcare is marketed and delivered in america . shs is organized as a virtual ,\
vertically integrated healthcare delivery system that coordinates the\
interaction of physicians , patients and ancillary medical service providers in a\
manner that is efficient and cost effective . the company currently manages\
medical clinics , diagnostic centers and clinical laboratories located in san\
jose , san francisco , concord and salinas , california . shs lowers healthcare\
costs by passing the savings gained from the advances in medicine and diagnostic\
technology through to the patient .\
commenting on this transaction , neil reithinger , president of epipharma ,\
stated , our intent with epipharma was to find the right fit with a partner such\
as shs that is established and profitable in the healthcare arena . uninsured\
americans deserve the opportunity to have the kind of affordable and quality\
healthcare that shs has been providing to the community . their multiple revenue\
streams and sustained growth are a testament to the overall strength of their\
business plan . now , as part of a public company , shs will have the opportunity\
to finance their growth . shs intends to develop more clinics in california and\
markets in other states to provide more americans with affordable medical\
services .\
some additional facts to help you be a sneak\
the\
u . s . census bureau data showed that the number of uninsured in the u . s . reached\
45 million in 2003 which is a 3 . 2 % increase over 2002 . the number of uninsured\
is predicted to increase to 53 million by 2010 if the situation does not change .\
there are 7\
million uninsured californians according to american health line . hispanics\
make - up the highest percentage of the uninsured in america and california\
according to the 2000 chart book prepared by the kaiser family foundation .\
the california state department of finance demographic research unit projects\
that the number of hispanics will grow from 10 million in 2000 to over 17\
million by 2020 .\
the company\
currently manages medical clinics , diagnostic centers and clinical laboratories\
located in san jose , san francisco , concord and salinas , california . shs lowers\
healthcare costs by passing the savings gained from the advances in medicine and\
diagnostic technology through to the patient .\
eighty percent\
of all healthcare expenditures in the u . s . are initiated by a doctor ' s\
prescription . shs captures the prescribing loyalty of physicians by giving them\
four things that help fulfill his or her professional and personal needs :\
more time to see more patients or spend at\
home with the family ; increased revenue for financial stability ; access\
to technology and electronic medical records ; and systems to remain in\
compliance with hipaa and osha rules and regulations .\
shs ' s\
target market is patients who pay cash for their medical care at the point of\
service . this market segment includes the uninsured , underinsured patients with\
high deductibles , patients wanting access to health screening and preventative\
care , and patients seeking second opinions because they are dissatisfied with\
their hmo or managed care health plans . the emerging consumer driven health\
care paradigm will dramatically increase the demand for low - cost medical\
services . eighty\
percent of all healthcare expenditures in the u . s . are initiated by a doctor ' s\
prescription . shs captures the prescribing loyalty of physicians by giving them\
four things that help fulfill his or her professional and personal needs :\
more time to see more patients or spend at\
home with the family ; increased revenue for financial stability ; access\
to technology and electronic medical records ; and systems to remain in\
compliance with hipaa and osha rules and regulations .\
shs\
addresses the american healthcare crisis : advances in medical technology ,\
increasing consumer demand for state - of - the - art medical treatment and the rising\
number of uninsured are being blamed for spiraling medical costs in the u . s .\
the pressures of rising medical costs is forcing the healthcare industry to\
change the way in which it delivers healthcare in america in the 21 st\
century .\
epipharma offers a\
terrific opportunity to maximize your rewards , be a sneak before the street jumps ahead of you . look for a\

Subject: this was the one recommended to me\
finally !\
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,\
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really\
wants is an extra inch !\
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving\
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it\
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .\
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i\
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original\
size . i was really surprised !\
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence\
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5\
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !\
the lengthening is permanent !\
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it\
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best\
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i\
forget !\
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if\
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your\
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !\
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends\
as new cells grow !\

i wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice . i would like\
each of you to review these times with your staff . the production release is\
the largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be\
shortened any more . production users will not be impacted by the lack of the\
parallel environment - we will continue to bridge deal updates to unify\
parallel as we do now for the period stated above ; however access to sitara\
parallel will be kept to view only . a list of items included in this release\
will be forthcoming , as well as training for groups impacted by the risk\

anita :\
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045\
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .\
date purchase volume sale\
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing\
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu\
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing\
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu\
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was\
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between\
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and\
hpl . hope this information helps .\

Subject: 2000 plan allocations\
attached is a file with my allocations of texas operations to be used for the\
2000 plan . however , please note that their are some problems / clean - up that\
needs to occur that i could not do .\
as you requested , i have taken the % we allocated to gas assets last year and\
put the appropriate % ' s into the appropriate group within gas assets as you\
have broken them out . please note : gas network trading is the same group as\
st gastexas ( group 8 ) - tom martin is responsible for both . i have indicated\
the appropriate % ' s into the new buckets , but i was not able to zero out the\
st gastexas group as the cells are protected . consequently , the total column\
indicates that i have allocated over 100 % . the # ' s in gas network trading\
are correct . will you please delete st gastexas so that no one will allocate\
to it ?\
when the plan allocations were submitted last year , there was an error in\
rcl 160 - volume management . i thought we corrected it but it is still\
showing up incorrectly . please move the 8 % under east origin to st gaseast .\
i was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected .\
please note : this is not a change from the plan , but a correction of an\
error .\
i would appreciate you correcting these things for me , and forwarding the\
corrected version back to me for my records . i will be working with our\
management team on the 1 / 00 allocations , and will provide you those by\
friday . please call me if you have any questions . thanks .\

howard ,\
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april\
of 1999 on\
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was\
shorted to keep\
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport\
imbalance was to be cleared\
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of\
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu\
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc\
index for the upcoming months\
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can\
clear this imbalance . we will\
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the\
purchase from ena by 91 , 297\
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant\
energy - entex allocation to\
make sure this happens .\

Subject: meter 1428 - brandywine / dupont and beamont methanol\
my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the\
following : to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling\
for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .\
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station\
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,\
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station\
before it gets to beamont methanol . sometimes we are doing business with\
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do\
business with one of them .\
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol :\
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789\
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558\
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with\
regard to scheduling and nomination issues . they are out of the loop on\
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant\
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues , it will cause confusion of\
the type we had yesterday and today .\
obviously , it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont\
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .\
thanks . . . and have a great weekend .\

Subject: cilco pathing - withdrawl and hplc transport pathing\
hey guys ,\
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that\
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think\
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the\
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -\
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below\
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of\
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling\
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially\
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down\
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly\
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am\
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what\
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their\
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you\
both think . thanks !\

stella :\
the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting\
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would\
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?\
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement\
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it\
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the\
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up\
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number\
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set\
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you\
can put the contract at meter 9643 .\
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .\

locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week . this\

i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced\
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day\
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a\
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter\
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the\
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is\
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be\
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale\
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to\
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when\
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each\
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,\
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have\
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .\

Subject: hpl optimization\
team ,\
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of\
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will\
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our\
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and\
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate\
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the\
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\
accomplish this objective across n . america .\
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the\
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for\
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the\
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related\
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific\
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding\
hpl to tim determing .\

subject : resolved issue : re : meter # 0986563 -\
fyi -\
it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -\
04 / 02 / 00 , were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase .\
therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period\
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any\
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please\
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .\
thank you all for your patience and assistance . i appreciate it !\

Subject: juvenile diabetes foundation fundraising\
it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s\
juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday ,\
november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the\
board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for\
this year ' s fundraising efforts .\
as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself .\
even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the\
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot\
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking\
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of\
complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it\
they would die .\
enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf\
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money\
raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise\
$ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5\
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team\
leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the\
walk this year is " knock out diabetes " and we would like to have you join us\
for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron\
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it .\
if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if\
you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee\
members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please\
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included\
in the first important and informative training session taking place this\
week .\
thank you very much for your support .\

i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee\
in your example # 1 .\
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .\

katherine ,\
there are 2 ways that i can enter this fee into sitara :\
1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .\
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i\
can ' t just input a dollar amount in sitara .\
let me know how you want to handle it .\

released to internal users in north america on wednesday , september 13 th .\
european internal users will be launched shortly after north america .\
external customers will follow a few days later .\
one of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load\
which will be caused by the full customer launch . accordingly , we appreciate\
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into\

are real .\

2 . version 2 . 0 launch date\
enrononline version 2 . 0 will be launched to the public a few days after our\
internal launch . we will be using the new version internally from wednesday ,\
sept . 13 . this will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with\
using the new application in the production environment before our customers\
start to use it .\
3 . new website feature details\
price limit orders : customers have the ability to set up orders that\
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become\
available . the limit orders remain open in the system until they are\
executed , cancelled by the user , or when they expire . all pending orders will\
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed .\
pending price limit orders will appear in a new window below the quotes\
screen in the website .\
product tabs : enrononline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to\
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them . users can\
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse . sort ordering can\
be changed by clicking on a column heading , with multiple sorts possible by\
holding down the shift key while clicking .\
floating windows : users have the ability to create multiple windows with\
different products by right - clicking on the products in the main quotes\
screen .\
market news : website users can now access the latest headlines , sports and\
industry news from reuters . furthermore , the information categories can be\
customized according to personal interests . to customize a particular\
category , users need to click the edit button in the category heading .\
all information categories can be collapsed to save space . to expand or\
collapse a category , users need to click the arrow to the left of the\
category heading .\
stock quotes : enrononline now offers stock quotes ( 20 min . delay ) from major\
exchanges around the world .\
weather insights : customers can now access weather maps and temperature data\
for specific cities and regions . weather forecasts , up to six days ahead ,\

industry - specific publications including argus european natural gas , argus\
european electricity , the news from ngi  , s daily gas price index , bandwidth\
desk , coal daily and more .\
4 . new stack manager features\
the stack manager has been updated to facilitate price limit orders . you will\
notice that there is a new button at the top of the stack manager , which will\
open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers\
against your managed products . you can click the " + " sign to the left of a\
summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed\
against that product .\
under normal circumstances , the price shown on the website will be the same\
as the price on your stack manager . however , the system will not allow you to\
show a price which is better than an existing price limit order . instead , the\
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price\
limit order while it is being filled . once the appropriate price limit orders\
are filled , then the website will again show your stack manager prices .\
it is important that you complete the  & maximum volume  8 field in the product\
properties window and that you select " allow price limit orders " . also , make\
sure that the price tick window in the stack manager  , s  & product properties  8\
field is appropriate for the product . if you do not do this , your customers\
will not be able to use price limit orders for your products .\
5 . your participation\
please log in to http : / / prod . enrononline . com ( no www . ) on wednesday . to\
ensure enrononline version 2 . 0 is a success , it is important that you have a\

Subject: budget help ! !\
salaries , salaries , salaries ! ! ! everyone is having problems .\
unfortunately , many of\
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your\
staff ' s salary is . i have the average\
salary for each of the different staffing levels . i have asked the hr\
department to also give me\
the low and the high . let ' s face it - your staff today and their salary most\
likely are not what\
they are going to be next year ! to much movement of people . so using\
estimates and averages\
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels .\
here ' s what you can do :\
1 ) make a list of your staff just their positions .\
2 ) then put down if you think i should budget high , mid , average , low , low to\
average , etc .\
you can guess at this based on their experience , length of time in that\
position , etc .\
3 ) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget .\
4 ) here is the average :\
sr . $ 4 , 961\
spec $ 3 , 964\
staff $ 3 , 026\
sr . clrk $ 2 , 548\
clerk $ 2 , 264\
asst $ 3 , 162\
your list would look something like this :\
assistant average\
clerk very high\
sr . clerk low\
specialist low to average\
specialist average\
sr . specialist average to high\
analyst ( they are all allocated at the same amount )\
you can , however , use the exact amounts if you have them . it ' s up to you .\
next item - training ! ! !\
here ' s what you can do :\
1 ) list your staff and the type of class they need\
2 ) if you don ' t know the exact class you want to send them to , then list what\
type\
of class - for example personal enrichment ( i . e . time management ) or\
technical ( derivatives or applied finance or wellhead to burnertip )\
3 ) the personal enrichment classes cost aroung $ 500 - $ 700\
4 ) the technical classes cost aroung $ 800 - $ 1000 .\
5 ) just list the type of class , and i ' ll do the rest .\
next item - headhunters !\
try 20 % of the new hires salary for their fees .\
other stuff - i have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the\
year that\
people forget about at budget time ( i . e . flowers for secretaries day , birthday\
ice cream , offsite meeting costs , customer gifts ) . if you forget these\
items , i will\
make sure it is added to your budget .\
once i put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets , we will\
review them\
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them . hopefully\
this helps you some .\

8 / 31 . on these dates , we bought gas from tenaska iv texas partners and sold\
to anp and tenaska marketing . because things were not set up , i could not\
enter the deals until now . please review the following deals and settle with\
the customers .\

Subject: re : duke cashout entries 7 / 00 and 8 / 00\
we did take into account the price adjustments you made . the actual purchase\
cashout for 8 / 00 was $ 118 , 103 . 67 . your pricing took care of most of the\
cashout , but there was still a balance . the over delivery pricing per mmbtu\
in the contract is the difference between hsc spot - 0 . 05 and hsc index , so\
gd - 0 . 10 didn ' t quite cover the entire cashout . i have attached the calc\
sheet in case you need it .\

Subject: information regarding batch noms on aug 5 , 6 & 7 , 2000\
daren :\
i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at\
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange\
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had\
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a\
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that\
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at\
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let\
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .\
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling\
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are\
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this\
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline\
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which\
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these\
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the\
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .\

my monthly newsletter is attached . please read it and let me\
know your comments .\
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping\
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do\
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of\
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home\
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest\
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on\
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs\
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the\
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and\
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping\
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,\
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .\

nick ,\
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel\
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the\
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .\
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i\
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call\
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to\
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was\

Subject: beaumont methanol - meter 1428 - october 2000\
ladies and gents :\
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a\
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will\
confirm this ) .\
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told\
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting\
back to a lower flow rate .\
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -\
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067\
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3\
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for\
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -\
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .\
please call with questions .\
thanks\

Subject: implementation of the gas message board application\
please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you\
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone\
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of\
your favorites .\
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .\
attached is the url for user to run the application .\
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com\
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the\
application .\
here is the steps they should do :\
1 ) launch internet explorer\
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and\
click on above url )\
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if\
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :\
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt\
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names\
into the group .\
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .\
4 ) click on " comments " button to add messages : there will be a popup window\
when user clicks on " comments " button . there are two ways to send the\
messages after typing the\
messages into the text box :\
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or\
( 2 ) click on " send " button to send the message .\
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main\
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message\
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .\
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10\
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will\
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the\
messages .\
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean\
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .\
note : right now the application is under test environment . if they like it , i\
will move it into production environment soon .\
let me know any feedbacks .\

gary ,\
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the\
month . since spinnaker was paid gas\
daily pricing for the month , there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when\
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual\
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we\
are going to owe spinnaker an additional\
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .\
one issue that needs to be addressed is this : should the additional money go\
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating\
out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration ?\
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :\
thank you all ! !\

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related\

majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing\
money to tenaska iv .\
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the\
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached\
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay\
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do\
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in\
the future .\

subject : tenaska iv 10 / 00\
we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is\
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a\
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up\
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1\
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i\
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the\
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73\
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to\
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james\
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be\
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can\
see the numbers .\

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about\
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out\
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the\
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece\
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is\
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .\

arre you saying that for both days that two ( 2 ) ena contracts should be\
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the\
total volume to each contract ?\

jackie ,\
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave\
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the\
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,\
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the\
interconnect report .\

your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where\
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for\
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena\
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase\
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting\
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because\

( 1 ) deals # 133196 or # 466305 extended to cover september and october 2000 ,\
( 2 ) a new deal to cover september and october 2000 , or ( 3 ) logistics needs\

or\

to all :\
the proposed sale of hpl to american electric power ( aep ) has been signed and\
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming\
months . over the next few days , i will be forwarding more details about the\
transition process . these details will outline the employment opportunities\
and transfer process to aep . aep is eager to complete these arrangements ,\
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it .\
during the transition period , it is important that we keep the pipe line\
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy\
needs of our customers .\

dear christian friends ,\
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !\
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .\
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .\
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .\
yours in his love and mercy ,\

i guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated\
during bidweek . if it is , then we do need to change the price to gd . if it\
is a new well behind the meter , you can either create a new deal ticket for\
this piece , or create a pricing tier on the old ticket .\

1 . you will be receiving emails from the migration team ( " gem " ) - please be sure to only open this from your own desktop , and not remotely . this is very important . these messages will be explaining the migration process and what you need to do to insure a successful migration .\
2 . due to new space limitations on your mailbox , you are advised to clean your notes mailbox of old , unneeded messages before migration . with outlook , you will be restricted to a mailbox size of 100 mb . outlook will issue a warning once you reach 75 mb to let you know that you are near your mailbox limit . once you reach 100 mb , you will be prevented from sending email , but you will still be able to receive internal and external messages you will then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail , saving attachments to a local drive , etc . before you will be able to send an email again .\
3 . from the day of migration , only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from your mailbox . this includes mail in your inbox and other folders . calendar items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated .\
4 . everyone will have a read only view of notes until the transition is completed . you will be able to copy / paste .\

we need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv . i am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand fee for feb 2001 for $ 29 , 851 . 64 , so i think we just need to change that to the new amount . let me know if you want to handle this differently .\

Subject: jill ,\
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .\
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .\
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .\
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?\
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .\
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .\
hungerford north - where is this ?\
bear den - where is this ?\
moore ' s station - where is this ?\
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .\
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being " good friday " and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .\
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .\

please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .\

that i need to finish it :\
january 2000 - i need deal # 854688 pathed for epgt and for tetc . according to the invoice , we should have\
11 , 129 dth on the interconnect .\
february 2000 - i need deal # 871184 pathed for hpl and chan . hpl should have 3 , 600 dth and chan should\
have 11 , 500 dth on the interconnect .\
july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth\
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly\

is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great\
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or\
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to\
you ) .\
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .\
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but\
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to\
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .\
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you\
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved\
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of\
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on\
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader\
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need ,\

how ' s the kids , wife , and home ( read that work project ) ?\
jen is home for a couple of weeks before heading back to waco . we are going up there to tour the new law school ( built with tobacco settlement money - - so we feel like contributators ) . she has four quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go .\
son still in florida . we plan to run over there in september for a few days . maybe do disneyworld .\
jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the nebraska game in waco this year . that should be fun . speaking of football , i see one texas team high in the polls . the other ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\
i got a new toy the other day . sears had a good sale on a power washer i ' ve had my eye on , so i bought it . just did the patio and deck . god , i thought painting was mindless work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\
also , found out from insurance company they will be funding an entirely new roof ( hail damage ? ? ? ) . i don ' t like the mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles i will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof .\

Subject: fw : classic\
thoughts on texas a & m . . .\
fox sports show host jim rome\
1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and\
red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in\
their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the\
feeling the entire school was built to spite ut .\
2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s\
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a\
subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach\
agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from\
where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m\
to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original\
creation . like danny devito in " twins " .\
3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must\
devote\
their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good .\
all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they\
won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how\
they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell\
them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is\
the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in\
everything a & m does .\
4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at\
a & m .\
there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '\
answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never\
learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,\
forget the fact that a however ,\
nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of\
the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act\
like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect\
these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is\
only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat\
up civilians , move to israel .\
5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national\
television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the\
stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be\
against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to\
mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime\
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and\
start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked\
down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have\
moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were\
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,\
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s\
thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a\
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .\
some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique\
counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give\
them a veil .\
6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if\
folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be\
funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .\
please learn .\
7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of\
sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall\
down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit\
whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for\
the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing\
how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for\
governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form\
asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight\
185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east\
texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade\
education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .\
this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .\
8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,\
they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .\
the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about\
marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high\
school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then\
and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you\
do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?\
9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the\
only\
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an\
anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .\
10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat\
their own feces and should be treated accordingly .\
11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that\
it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that\

subject : fw : crm database\
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .\
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .\
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !\
if you have any questions , please let me know .\

subject : crm database\
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .\
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :\
1 . account & contact management\
2 . activity tracking & planning\
3 . potential deal management\
4 . outlook synchronization\
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization\
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity\
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :\
industrial mkts freight mkts\
users 175 45\
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000\
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000\
activities 1 , 200 900\
quotes 150\
opportunities 361 11\
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :\
eol\
global mkts\
ees\
transportation\
east power orig\
insolvent debt\
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .\
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .\
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .\

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) .\
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .\

wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .\
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a " final or startup " list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .\
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .\
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .\
thanks - bob\
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .\
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -\
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise\
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .\
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .\
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen\
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )\
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate\
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .\
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .\
( iv ) due diligence\
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .|0
Subject: cleburne issues\
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :\
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50\
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00\
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50\
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )\
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50\
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?\
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .\
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .\

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .\
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .\
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .\
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .\
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .\

mr francis oma\
attn : director / ceo ,\
a cry for family help .\
i am mr francis oma the first son of the late mr . peter oma . my father had served mr b . h . lions who was an irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village . my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death . my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe . he also became a successful businessman , because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing , my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence .\
we left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $ 11 . 5 m ( eleven million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) and valuables ( diamonds ) worth us $ 5 m . my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival .\
he also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition .\
barely two months after we moved to johannesburg , we got information that my father ' s farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed . my father ' s property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans .\
i believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms . we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives . our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund . have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer . your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum , 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i . the diamond will be discussed at our arrival .\
we do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard . we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us , should this proposal meet your utmost consideration , please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address .\
the confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands . please treat this proposal with the utmost regard , and the confidentiality of these business should not be over - emphasised .\
please response on this email address ; francisoma @ zwallet . com\
waiting for your favourable response .\
thanks and god bless ,\
( from mr francis oma ) .\

explosive short term trading profits in a new technology\
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many\
significant news releases indicate strong contractual\
revenues with major telecom firms .\
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications\
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4\
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with\
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands\
for their innovative patented products and expansion into\
international telecom markets .\
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader\
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior\
patented outside plant electrical surge protection\
equipment for the telecommunications industry .\
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion\
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the\
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate\
the industry .\
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest\
quality protection element for complex digital switches .\
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to\
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions\
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus\
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .\
major telecoms require this protection throughout their\
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming\
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive\
system failures .\

how many times have you seen issues explode but you\
couldn ' t get your hands on them or didn ' t have the right\
information in time ? we are alerting you now to a special\
company with a unique technology that is on the forefront\
of a breakout ! we are excited about srge ' s technology\
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with\
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases\
in revenue for 2004 and 2005 . srge has made phenomenal\
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in\
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued ,\
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative .\

Subject: please read this\
hi there\
hope you don ' t mind me contacting you , but i thought you may be interested\
in\
this , as like me , you are obviously serious about making some money . . .\
i have heard nothing but great things about this . so give it a shot .\
 5 . . . that ' s all it takes . . .\
i ' ll keep it short and sweet .\
to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it\
in an\
e - mail to edit it .\
once i got started the money started rolling in ! ! ! just like the plan below\
said it would !\
i am currently getting over  200 a day and just started\
weekago ! ! ! ! !\
believe it or not , this is my 2 nd time around . simply follow the\
instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks , you will have at least  20 , 000 in\
your\
paypal account .\
most people respond to this program because of the low investment (  5 ) and\
high profit potential . the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 % . there is no\
limit\
to the income you can generate from this business ( you can do it over and\
over ) . this program is the fastest , easiest program you will ever do .\
the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place .\
if\
they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to , and\
only\
make a few pounds .\
if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people ! honesty ,\
faith and integrity make this system work .\
team work makes the dream work ! lets get started !\
i think everyone has heard of " paypal " ( if not you will ) . paypal ( owned by\
ebay ) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online . anyone\
with\
an email address can join for free ! if you ' re not already a paypal user , the\
first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free :\
use the link above to sign up for a free account , then send a  5 . 00 donation\
from\
your paypal account ( you will earn back  5 . 00 from paypal , for signing up\
anyway ! ) to only the first email address on the list along with a note\
saying : " please add me to your mailing list " .\
now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying " thanks i ' ve joined " .\
then , remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom .\
this\
should move the second place into the first place and the third place into\
second and fourth into the third .\
don ' t try to place yourself in the first place .\
it will only reach the people you send it to , and then your name will be\
removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system\
work .\
if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time\
your name gets to the top . remember to only send a  5 . 00 donation to the\
first\
e - mail address , and send " thanks i ' ve joined " to the fourth person . this\
lets the\
4 th person keep track of their progress .\
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\
1 . siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail . com\
2 . jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail . com\
3 . @ hotmail . com\
4 . nic @ madstock . freeserve . co . uk\
now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth\
person a note , place your email address in the fourth place ( make sure its\
the\
same email address you used for your paypal account ) this is the way you\
will\
receive payment .\
ok , the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more ( ! ) of\
this\
letter in a week or so . when your name reaches the top of the list it will\
be\
your turn to collect your money from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people just like\
yourself\
who are willing to spend  5 . 00 and half an hour of there time to receive\
 20 , 000\
in cash ! keep in mind . . . the most you ' ve spent is  5 .\
testimonials : d . rayner london : i only have one thing to say to\
you . . . . oh my god ! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on\
holiday . when i got back my account had over  12 , 000 in it already ! i ' m\
still\
floating on air ( especially with my new car i bought ! ) !\
thanks !\
this programe works , it really does .\
so good luck to the rest of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !|1

mineral exploration stockp\
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp\
controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq .\
miles ) in montana . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and\
gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source :\
company website ) currently trading at . 012 p\
possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has\
started and is expected to last all week . pp\
imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so\
if you had the scoop on the following stock : p\
( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this\
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5\
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p\
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of\
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\
otc : dmxpp\
about the company : p\
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\
located over what management considers to be some of the most\
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\
found in north america . p\
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\
moves forward . p\
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\
delta has experienced significant technical success since its\
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\
exploration is justified . p\
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\
finance additional exploration . p\
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .\
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\
extensive exploration program . pp\
( source : company website ) p\
recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\
delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\
conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\
delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\
preparation of work program . p\
delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\
exploration findings in south america . p\
delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\
exploration in south america . pp\
will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\
the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not\
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is\
critical . good luck and happy trading . pp\

major breaking news : cdyv expands publication into the\
dallas / ft . worth , texas metroplex area resulting in\
circulation of 3 million copies monthly . revenues to\
exceed 30 mill annually with nearly\
15 mill bottom - line profit .\
cdyv positioned as likely takeover candidate by the\
always acquisition - minded leaders of the publishing\
industry capturing sales of 20 billion .\
cdyv is the leading advertising , printing , and publishing\
company in texas specializing in the very high - profit\
sector of community - based weekly publications . as master\
publisher for the state of texas , cdyv reaches 22 million\
people , 254 counties , and over 3 , 100 towns and cities\
with their tidbits publication featuring local\
advertising in dozens of areas including entertainment ,\
real estate / housing , consumer goods and services , and\
major retailers like walgreens and dollar general .\
cdyv has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly ,\
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets .\
cdyv is new to the stock market , having gone public in a\
very quiet manner . so you have a very brief period to\
get in at or near the bottom before share prices soar on\
increased investor awareness . there are very few companies\
that have perfected this niche of advertising platform\
with none being publicly offered starting out at less than\
50 cents per share .\
monthly circulation has jumped from 500 , 000 to 3 million\
with the additional expansion into dallas / ft . worth ,\
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and\
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues\
from the metroplex area alone . cdyv will also provide the\
necessary printing services for 150 other national\
publishers in their respective states resulting in another\
9 . 5 million in yearly sales , with 50 % to the bottom - line ,\
on top of their already explosive , record - shattering figures .\
the publishing industry has always been an active leader in\
mergers , takeovers , and acquisitions . dow jones ( dj , 37 . 00 ,\
pe 32 ) , gannett ( gci , 79 . 00 , pe 16 ) , knight - ridder\
( kri , 65 . 00 , pe 16 ) , and tribune co . ( trb , 40 . 00 , pe 24 )\
are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent\
billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and\
profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies . cdyv\
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as\
their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings\
figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a\
share price of 5 . 00 for cdyv would be a very conservative\
valuation .\
it is only a matter of time before detailed information is\

the oi \| and gas advisory\
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,\
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining\
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .\
emerson oi \| and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil beit\
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating\
potentia \| of miilions per week .\
breaking news ! ! !\
emerson oi \| and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas\
providing opportunity\
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large\
recoverabie reserves\
south texas in a \| arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled\
by major oil companies\
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia \| recoverable\
reserves , estimated at over\
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the\
two pay zones .\
symbo \| - eogi\
price - . 065\
the value of eogi ' s shares wi \| \| skyrocket :\
1 . price charts confirm oi \| prices are experiencing the strongest buil\
market in a generation .\
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the \| ast two years .\
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on\
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for \| ess than 1 / 4 the\
vaiue of its assets .\
4 . emerson oi \| and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn\
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .\
aiready shares in the oi \| and gas sector are rising faster than the\
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry\
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized\
explorers and deveiopers \| ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are\
being made . in the \| ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and\
even quadruple returns .\
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued\
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for \| ong . this smail company\
with a comparably sma \| \| market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil\
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with\
the daily jump in energy prices .\
but a \| \| that wi \| \| change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move\
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to\
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa \| \| y expiosive\
effect on the share price .\
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson\
oil and gas ' shares ? wel \| we do know this - the great thing about\
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases\
in the price of oi \| and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or\
deciine\
slightiy , you will stil \| make a very heaithy return . of course , energy\
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year\
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings\
wil \|\
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi \| \| be\
staggering .\
overal \| , we consider eogi to be one of the \| ast outstanding energy\
piays in the oi \| and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,\
eogi shares wil \| surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have\
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and\
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive\
production .\
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona \| news in\
this\
area wil \| reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets\
upward in next week ' s bu \| \| etin .\

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045\
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .\
date purchase volume sale\
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing\
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu\
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing\
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu\
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was\
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between\
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and\
hpl . hope this information helps .\

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance\
howard ,\
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april\
of 1999 on\
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was\
shorted to keep\
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport\
imbalance was to be cleared\
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of\
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu\
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc\
index for the upcoming months\
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can\
clear this imbalance . we will\
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the\
purchase from ena by 91 , 297\
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant\
energy - entex allocation to\
make sure this happens .\
thanks ,\

Subject: winter cap for entex\
when you get allocations for january , we need to look at daily volumes for\
transaction # 1 . towards the end of the month , entex was approaching its jan\
winter cap volume of 550 , 000 / day . if the daily volume for trans # 1 comes out\
greater than 550 , the excess must be charged at gd + 10 . the numbers thus far\

differ .\

there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the\

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a\
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not\

the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting\

you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?\
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement\
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it\
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the\
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up\
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number\
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set\
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you\
can put the contract at meter 9643 .\

Subject: sitara position\
please use the position manager home button .\
when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details\
or change the dates , the position manager keeps\
all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the\
back and forward buttons to keep your views running .\
on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to\
go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder\
to keep all the old views active and updated .\
the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had\
up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your\
position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .\
this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .\
if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,\
the position manager is still keeping all the your views for\

what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out\
the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having\
30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position\
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .\
we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far\
as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be\
slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to\
limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time\
i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please\
remember to use your home button .\
other helpful hints -\
did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool\
bar text labels -\
did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and\
zones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel -\
if you have an omicron position porfolio - your min / max button shows you\
actual - and min / max for your day swing deals .\

subject : mobil discrepancies\
lee ,\
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on\
centana :\
purchase from mobil :\
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by\
mobil .\
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in\
sitara ) .\
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his\
gas , right ?\
sale to mobil :\
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,\
299 , 893\
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .\
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil\
because\
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,\
the\
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the\
gas\
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the\
system .\
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have\
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how\
did it work ?\
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller\
volumes\
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will\
help me\
with the other months .\
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me\
relating to\
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i\
can bring\
the pipe statements to you if that would help .\
thanks ,\

please be advised that contract no . teco 9121 shows in the global contract\

pg & e gas transmission teco , inc . . apparently , the pipeline name was entered\

transmission teco , inc . . the contract name should be pg & e gas transmission\

i would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name\
effective april 1 , 2000 . thus it will not affect the previous noms for this\

Subject: march surveys\
hello ,\
we have prepared january and february data and will be scheduling meetings\
with you in the next few weeks . for the month of march , please provide a\
completed " hours " survey for each position within your group . this survey\
will collect the time your team spent on performing their activities in the\
month of march .\
note : we are now collecting eol related activities . if you spend time\
directly supporting eol , and your survey does not have an activity that you\
can assign these times to , please contact me as soon as possible so we can\
add the appropriate activities to your survey .\
to fill out the survey :\
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labelled " select your rc " .\
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .\
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message " select\
position from drop box ! " you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,\
specialist , etc . ) and " ok " . the choices for positions are based on\
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed\
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that\
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of\
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity\
listed in the column labelled " hours " .\
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the\
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .\
if you do not , the information will be lost .\
we have included february compiled hours per position ( if you had two\
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the " last month "\
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you\
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send\
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill\
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you\
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible\
for a copy of the activity dictionary .\
please return these surveys by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if this is a\
problem , please notify me or lisa cousino immediately .\

daren ,\
i hate to be a pest but here ' s the deal on the above two meters :\
98 - 1600 sitara deal # 159194 expired on 2 / 29 / 2000 . the flow for 2 / 2000 was\
on the 215 k . this meter ( del . ) flowed 53 . 863 for 3 / 2000 . there is no new\
deal referenced , nor is the evergreen flag in effect .\
98 - 6725 sitara deal # 214948 expired 3 / 27 / 2000 . no evergreen and no new deal\
referenced . this is a little premature but this meter is active monthly\
and i ' m thinking that it will flow for this month with no k being applied .\

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician\
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he\
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the\
process of doing this .\
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s\
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the\
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this\
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the\
valve .\

in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow\
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we\
can investigate before we get commercial involved .\

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .\
volume issues :\
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day\
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is\
received ) .\
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research\
is necessary as soon as possible .\
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of\
interconnect variances by day .\
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the\
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .\
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding\
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary\
correction .\
rate issues :\
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .\
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily\
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates\
from pg & e texas .\
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their\
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this\
course of action .\
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so\
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .\
there are no open invoices in settlements .\
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per\
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior\
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between\
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s\
verification .\
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts\
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena\
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having\
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk\
deal .\
he has not had a response from legal yet .|0

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment\
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company\
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing\
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success\
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on\
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in\
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their\
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review\
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement\
methodology for the london office .\
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards\
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment\
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and\
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and\
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .\
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so\
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those\
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not\
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to\
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :\
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash\
collections are timely )\
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its\
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date\
with exceptions noted )\
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard\
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )\
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each\
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )\
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control\
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of\
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time\
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to\
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a\
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but\
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .\
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for\
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk\
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and\
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know\
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward\
to seeing you next week .|0

transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of\
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the\
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my\
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of\
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to\
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with\
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this\
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for\
data quality and timeliness .\
the attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial\

transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s\

and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i\
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was\
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate\
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their\
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we\
are , they\
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you\
will have better luck than i did .\

Subject: hpl optimization\
team ,\
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of\
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will\
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our\
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and\
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate\
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the\
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\
accomplish this objective across n . america .\
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the\
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for\
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the\
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related\
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific\
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding\
hpl to tim determing .\

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been\
able to determine from the information available to me .\
to your questions :\
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on\
monday when she returns .\
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain\
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .\
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during\
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming\
one was not located .\
hope this helps .\

the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations\

covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be\

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from\
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960\
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .\
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis\
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content\
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind\
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit\
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its\
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner\
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible\
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s\
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to\
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor\
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?\

request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and\

will better help you in representing them .\
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and\
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to\
everyone else in their peer group .\
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key\
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports\
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your\
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session\
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed\
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which\
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the\
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .\
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .\
let me know if you have any questions .\

imbalances :\
i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our\
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .\
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but\
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this\
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?\
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :\
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?\
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to\
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?\
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?\
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?\
duke energy 206 is still a problem .\
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large\
number to me , can we net some of them ?\
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex\
contract ?\
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that\
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have\
the right to use .\
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf\
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?\
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid\
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .\
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this\
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some\
where we are owed ?\
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?\
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?\
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?\
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?\
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,\
how old is this imbalnce ?\
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to\
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?\
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the\
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can\
we resolve this ?\
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to\
have to work on a better way to check our positions .\
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james\
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to\
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with\
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we\
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the\
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get\
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract\
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .|0

subject : re : rate for tenaska deal\
sandi ,\
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .\
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated\
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will\
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .\
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the\
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals\
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a\
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to\
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at\
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they\
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do\
you agree with this ?\

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you\

how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater\
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual\
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?\
based on what index ?\

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say\
that duke should be paying us for the gas .\
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i\
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the\
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the\
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard\
back from anyone .\
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this\
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can\
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )\
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you\
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct\
contract in place for the deal .\

best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of\
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home\
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest\
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on\
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs\
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the\
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and\
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping\
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,\

Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18\
vance :\
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,\
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .\
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts\
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .\
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads\
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will\
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .\
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells\
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal\
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another\
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced\
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result\
in a financial loss ) .\
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow\
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon\
as i ascertain that date .\
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals\
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that\
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing\
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish\
this .\
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,\

hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,\
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased\
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of\
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to\
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .\
resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should\
take the deal to zero by " unwinding " it .\

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18\
vance :\
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,\
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .\
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts\
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .\
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads\
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will\
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .\
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells\
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal\
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another\
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced\
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result\
in a financial loss ) .\
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow\
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon\
as i ascertain that date .\
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals\
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that\
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing\
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish\
this .\
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,\

nick ,\
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel\
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the\
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .\
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i\
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call\
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to\
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was\
shut - in .\
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .\

there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the\

jackie ,\
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave\
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the\
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,\
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the\

your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where\

these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena\
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase\
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting\
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because\

subject : tenaska iv gas\
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and\
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few\
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was\
cancelled ) :\
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should\
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )\
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -\
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at\
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .\
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged\
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91\
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at\
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .\
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for\
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment\
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and\
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at\
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .\
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price\
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache\
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at\
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if\
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a\
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant\
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .\
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and\
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from\
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot\
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our\
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of\
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas\
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .\
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their\
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price\
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of\
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of\
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .\
month plant gas price amount\
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843\
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )\
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )\
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000\
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52\
total $ 484 , 234 . 03\
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before\
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts\
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .\

after getting your imput , i think this is the best :\
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be\
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need\
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to\
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a\
bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a\
better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be\
different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization\
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing\
the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not\
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus .\

subject : basin production from ga 213\
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production\
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees\
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the\
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect\
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best\
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve\
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the\
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows\
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next\
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and\
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited\
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this\
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning\
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close\
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for\
liquids fallout .|0

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for\

attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &\

Subject: california energy crisis\
california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\
what happened in california\
the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\
in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\
enron ' s role\
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\
? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\
enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\
the solution\
the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .\
increasing supply\
california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\
reducing demand\
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\
reducing reliance on the spot market\
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\
restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions\
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .|0

i guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek . if it is , then we do need to change the price to gd . if it is a new well behind the meter , you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece , or create a pricing tier on the old ticket .\

and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver\

our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest .\
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to\
fuel . we are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu / d knowing that we should start\
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month\
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .\

i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar\

hpl or channel .\
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going\
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,\
can hpl sever the point some other way ?\

Subject: fw : hpl imbalance payback\
now that we have a transport agreement on hpl . on physical payback , i think the\
best way would be to have the imbalance transfered to our agreement and then schedule\
the payback directly to us .\
i guess we need to work this out with the aep people . i have talked to kim lastraps about\
this . can you guys follow up and let me know what you decided .\
thanks\

subject : re : cell phones\
the latest is that if they want to keep their phones , they need to fill out a contract changing the liability to them .\
we will have some in our office tomorrow around 1 ( ran out today ) and they can also pick one up at a cingular store . just make sure that they mail them back to me .\
my home address is : 4501 shetland houston 77027\
as for the cancellation of the corporate phones , that is not scheduled to take place yet , and may not right away .\
if they just want to do a rate plan change , then they can do it via email ( have them email me ) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability .\
the main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability , which also obligates them for one year .\
as for the balances accrued up to date , they are not responsible for those . enron is .\
good luck to you . i hope you get my email and i hope i get to see you again .\
and , yes , i will be getting all new accounts now !\

hi ! any word yet about the cell phones ? i ' m getting nervous , as are a lot of others , i ' m sure . some people in my group are really wanting to keep their phones , and they are asking me questions that i don ' t know the answers to . . . like what kinds of rate changes there will be , as well as to what point will the liability be theirs , and how far back will they have to pay to get the invoices current , if enron has not done so already .\
how are you affected by this ? will cingular find another business that you will work out of ? just curious .\

Subject: northern natural gas\
yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .\
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .\
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .\
ken\
dear ets colleague :\
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .\
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .\
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .\
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .\
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !\

Subject: cleburne issues\
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :\
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50\
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00\
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50\
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )\
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50\
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?\
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .\
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .\

Subject: from mrs . juliana\
dear friend ,\
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do\
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the\
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was\
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through\
network online hence decided to write you .\
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .\
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on\
diplomatic\
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual\
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five\
hundred\
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed\
the\
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does\
not know\
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /\
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .\
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries\
and\
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .\
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe\
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white\
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing\
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the\
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of\
people\
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was\
one\
of\
the victims .\
it is against this background that , all my family members fled\
zimbabwe\
for fear of our\
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort\
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late\
husband ' s\
money to a more\
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the\
money is not being used ,\
lying in the security company .\
i must let you know that this transaction is\
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .\
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our\
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to\
be done to finalize all the arrangements with\
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after\
reaching a workable agreement with you .\
barrister hope martins law chambers ,\
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm\
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear\
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in\
the\
custody of the diplomatic firm .\
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the\
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with\
your advice\
this matter require maturity and trust .\
regards ,\
mrs . juliana mbuluku\

press\
release\
international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients .\
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area .\
as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) .\
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to " ride out the storm . "\
by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .\
as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .\
since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .\
in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .\
the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :\
1 ) building very little " owned " infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .\
2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .\
3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .\
the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .\
the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .\
the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .\

its networks / teleconnect has become one of the top four calling card providers in spain . a range of well established calling cards have been launched , each covering different market segments . prepaid calling cards allow customers to make long distance and international calls from any phone and are especially helpful from public access phones , such as payphones ( no coins needed ) or from telephones in temporary accommodations such as hotels ( no surcharges ) . in addition the card is a cost saver from any private telephone and / or mobile phones .\
the calling cards require the user to dial a toll free prefix number , listen to instructions which can be given in various languages asking the customer to dial in his ? code ? or ? pin ? , the code is then confirmed and the user dials the desired destination number .\
the cards are distributed through various sales channels , and can be purchased at a variety of local merchants , kiosks , etc and are used primarily by tourists , foreign residents , students and immigrants .\

re : transfer of ( usd 26 million )\
i want to transfer to overseas ( $ 26 , 000 . 000 . 00 usd ) twenty six million united states dollars ) from ecobank , benin . i have the courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and confidential business to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this money , even an empty a / c can serve to receive this funds quitely .\
i am dr kenneth okoh the accountant / auditor in ecobank , benin and personal confidant to dr . ravindra f . shah who died together with his wife dr . mrs . manjula parikh - shah in a planecrash on the lst oct . 2003 on their way to attend a wedding in boston .\
mr . ravindra f . shah , is an american , a physician and industrialist , he died last year without having any beneficiary to his assets including his account herein benin which he opened in a eco bank , benin in the year 2000 as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company before his untimely death in 2003 . the amount involved is ( usd\
26 , 000 . 000 . 00 usd ) twenty six million united states dollars and no other person knows about this account . i am contacting you for me to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary , i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here , without valid international foreign passport , but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a / c because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a / c mr . ravindra f . shah is a foreigner too , and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a / c .\
however , i am revealing this to you with belief in god that you will never let me down in this business . you are the first and the only person that i am contacting for this business , so please reply urgently so that i will inform you the next step to take urgently . send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the transfer . i need your full co - operation to make this work because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with\
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business .\
at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 40 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me . i look forward to your earliest reply through\
my email or you call me on phone .\
yours ' faithfully ,\

market watch news flash\
explosive short term trading profits in a new technology\
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many\
significant news releases indicate strong contractual\
revenues with major telecom firms .\
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications\
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4\
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with\
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands\
for their innovative patented products and expansion into\
international telecom markets .\
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader\
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior\
patented outside plant electrical surge protection\
equipment for the telecommunications industry .\
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion\
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the\
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate\
the industry .\
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest\
quality protection element for complex digital switches .\
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to\
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions\
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus\
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .\
major telecoms require this protection throughout their\
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming\
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive\
system failures .\

10 day target : 2 . 30\
1 month target : 4 . 50\
outstanding shares : 16 . 5 million\
est . float : 2 . 2 million\
how many times have you seen issues explode but you\
couldn ' t get your hands on them or didn ' t have the right\
information in time ? we are alerting you now to a special\
company with a unique technology that is on the forefront\
of a breakout ! we are excited about srge ' s technology\
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with\
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases\
in revenue for 2004 and 2005 . srge has made phenomenal\
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in\
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued ,\
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative .\

recent headlines :\
* nathaniel energy corp . extends agreement with cimarron industrial park\
authority to develop 190 acre site for waste - to - energy plant .\
* nathaniel energy announces financial results with 2004 first quarter\
revenue of $ 3 . 3 million\
about the company : turning carbon based materials into inexpensive\
electrical and thermal energy : here is the sizzle . . . . . . .\
nathaniel energy provides industry with an alternative energy comparable to\
that of fossil fuels . its proprietary patented technology , the thermal\
combustor ( tm ) , is a 2 - stage gasification system designed to combust waste ,\
biomass , tires and any other solid , carbon - based materials into inexpensive\
electrical and thermal energy , while exceeding the most stringent epa and\
european union regulations .\
* necx * * *\
strongly consider the following points :\
* many of these stocks are undiscovered and uncovered ! when wall street gets\
a whiff of them , look out ! !\
* * many of these undiscovered stocks are like coiled springs , wound tighter\
than a sling shot under the surface - and ready to explode ! this company is\
uncovered by wall street !\
* all it takes is an explosive news announcement , some savvy investors or a\
mutual fund to get wind of this company and necx could go ballistic ! !\

three studies assessed staphylococcal endocarditis 21 48 63 one study\
assessed any staphylococcal infection 32 and one assessed streptococcal\
endocarditis 69 treatment is well ingrained in\
existing guidelines and clinical practice with these infections 94 so what\
have i done about it ? well its still a practicing effort , but i dont just\
listen to what a man says . i look to see the connection in a mans actions .\
are they putting as much of an effort into the relationship ? do i feel that\
they really feel what they say they are feeling ? and to a fault , i am\
skeptical at best that they truly mean what they say . our best ally is our\
gut feeling c and we are very guilty of ignoring it . when we ignore it we\

you don ' t know me from adam . : ) iyakubonana\
nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours .\
i don ' t deserve this award , but i have arthritis , and i don ' t deserve that , either . the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother .\
tricks and treachery are the practice of fools , that don ' t have brains enough to be honest .\
a heart that loves is always young .\
if you drink , don ' t drive . don ' t even putt .\
husbands never become good they merely become proficient .\
only from the heart can you touch the sky .\
even if it is to be , what end do you serve by running to distress ? it is a terrible thing to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead - - and find no one there .\
i hated her now with a hatred more fatal than indifference because it was the other side of love .\

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best\
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original\
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .\
q :\
what\
is considered factory refurbished ?\
a : there are lots of\
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so\
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent\
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished\
as " new " , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few\
examples :\
manufacturers /\
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /\
country .\
to avoid\
" disturbing " the dealer / reseller channel in different\
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the\
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .\
most major retail\
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their\
products and there are those consumers that just simply take\
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,\
inspected and repackaged like new .\
items where the\
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the\
manufacturer .\
the item was\
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the\
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested\
and then repackaged just like new .\
the item was\
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that\
was corrected .\
demonstration\
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are\
inspected , tested and repackaged .\
the box was simply\
opened . thats it !\
brand new\
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .\
all factory\
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the\
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product\
specifications . all\
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer\

about istorage networks :\
istorage networks , inc . develops and markets network storage solutions that are specifically designed for the small to medium business . computer activity has obviously grown over the last few years , especially driven by electronic mail ( e - mail ) . this demand is further propagated by digital photos , video files and new high image applications . federal requirements for audit trails , medical records and as well as security , add to this acceleration for the need of network storage capacity . istorage with its expertise and experience in the worldwide storage industry , coupled with its technology and channel partners , can deliver products that are simple to use and affordable to meet these needs .\
istorage products utilize a new and emerging technology called iscsi . iscsi , is an ip ( internet protocol ) based standard for linking data storage devices over a network and transferring the users data . from the storage side , iscsi uses the scsi command set , the core storage commands used throughout all storage configurations . on the networking side , iscsi uses ip and ethernet , which are the basis for most corporate networks . this revolutionary technology utilizes a standard disk drive interface and internet communications techniques , and provides an easy method for user ' s to manage data .\
the purchase orders have been issued through the company ' s international resellers for projects in the automotive manufacturing and petrochemical refinery industry . these orders are the result of our efforts to date in developing the worldwide sales channel for our product offerings , said roger kirkland , vp sales and marketing for istorage . he also added the company is well positioned to support the growing marketplace in the small to medium business sector . these orders are for immediate shipment\

traders ' monthly alert\
january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 ,\
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) !\
our next pick is an incredible find that will\
outperform all others based on their solid\
numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in\
financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal\
with chinese government - run companies totaling\
$ 10 billion !\
urgent buy at any price :\
global environmental energy corp .\
otcbb - geec\
current price - 1 . 90\
running to - 6 . 00\
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj\
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this\
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge ,\
and honeywell .\
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the\
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of\
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !\
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume\
indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of\
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader\
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,\
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible\
to assign a value to the size of the market .\
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their\
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety\
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major\
impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and\
environmentally safe process converts into clean , green\
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,\
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,\
industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural\
gas , and the huge market of used tires .\
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity\
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is\
then sold to replenish the local or national grid .\
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide\
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a\
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the\
disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance\
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact\
the global waste problem while a major push for generating\
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot\
topic due to shortages and massive power failures .\
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with\
chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal\
mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300\
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill\
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two\
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3\
billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,\
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting\
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line\
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable\
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china\
meet its energy needs .\
the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip\
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares\
should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a\
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still\
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look\
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will\
ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most\
explosive gains on wall street .\

the oi \| and gas advisory\
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,\
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining\
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .\

and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating\
potentia \| of miilions per week .\
breaking news ! ! !\
emerson oi \| and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas\
providing opportunity\
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large\
recoverabie reserves\
south texas in a \| arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled\
by major oil companies\
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia \| recoverable\
reserves , estimated at over\
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the\
two pay zones .\
symbo \| - eogi\
price - . 065\
the value of eogi ' s shares wi \| \| skyrocket :\
1 . price charts confirm oi \| prices are experiencing the strongest buil\
market in a generation .\
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the \| ast two years .\
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on\
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for \| ess than 1 / 4 the\
vaiue of its assets .\
4 . emerson oi \| and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn\
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .\
aiready shares in the oi \| and gas sector are rising faster than the\
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry\
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized\
explorers and deveiopers \| ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are\
being made . in the \| ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and\
even quadruple returns .\
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued\
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for \| ong . this smail company\
with a comparably sma \| \| market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil\
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with\
the daily jump in energy prices .\
but a \| \| that wi \| \| change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move\
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to\
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa \| \| y expiosive\
effect on the share price .\
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson\
oil and gas ' shares ? wel \| we do know this - the great thing about\
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases\
in the price of oi \| and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or\
deciine\
slightiy , you will stil \| make a very heaithy return . of course , energy\
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year\
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings\
wil \|\
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi \| \| be\
staggering .\
overal \| , we consider eogi to be one of the \| ast outstanding energy\
piays in the oi \| and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,\
eogi shares wil \| surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have\
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and\
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive\
production .\
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona \| news in\

fyi - attached is a complaint filed by care on april 16 against bc hydro , powerex , mirant and bpa ( with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent ) . the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex . it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand " to contrive a shortage and test their market power . " care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section 206 of the fpa , state and federal anti - trust laws , the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and nafta .\
the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts . the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane ( we think it is an avista trader ) , selected transmission data from the iso , the la times article of april 11 , 2001 regarding the iso ' s report on powerex , bpa and ladwp , the iso report itself , and bc hydro ' s residential rate schedule . care requests ferc to initiate an investigation , seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section 202 ( c ) of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity .\
ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may 8 as the due date for interventions and responses .\

Subject: here ' s a reminder . . .\
dear traders ,\
here are a couple of things i ' ve thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute . please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research .\
1 . ) all notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them . notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders ' interpretation .\
2 . ) can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times ? i often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason .\
3 . ) one thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the inc sheets , however , i still sometimes find that the trader ' s notes and the inc sheets or the el paso model don ' t match . at that point , i don ' t know which one to go by . i need to be sure that i can trust the accuracy of the inc sheets as the end - all .\
4 . ) please make sure that all real - time deals or real - time extended deals are getting routed . i ' ve come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate . it also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes .\
5 . ) please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled . i ' ve seen a few deals that are in the traders ' notebooks , but that haven ' t been entered in enpower . you know the result .\
6 . ) cuts ( need i say more ) . . . are a mess . i really really need to see notes on every cut ! ! ! ! ! this means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database and notes in deal scheduling !\
when a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut , i need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note . many of my dms ' s could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in enpower ( this means i found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in enpower ) . i specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule : where did resupply come from ( deal # too ) ? was it a bookout ( deal # too ) ? what ' s the resupply price ? who at the counterparty did our trader talk to ? what is the reason for the cut ? and please initial your notes so that if i have a question about them , i know who to ask .\
you can never make too many notes ! !\
one thing to remember is that deal entry , deal scheduling , and lotus notes do not communicate with each other , so though it is a grueling task , every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places . ( it ' s called copy and paste )\
if we can keep these things in mind , i think we will have fewer disputes in the future . and when we do have disputes , i ' ll be able to figure them out in a more timely manner .\
thanks for your attention to these things . i look forward to bugging you less in the future .\

Subject: revised real - time generation for saturday 6 / 9\
there are a few changes to saturday ' s schedule , so please disregard my previous email .\
group ,\
the plan has slightly changed for submitting supplemental bids for our generators for saturday , 6 / 9 . the plan is as follows :\
only submit supplemental bids for the generators if a stage 1 emergency is called . this is due to the iso ' s ability to ramp the units up and down every 10 minutes . we don ' t want to give them the ability to do this if there is not a stage 1 , 2 , or 3 emergency .\
so , please try to sell the generators excess available output as an sc to sc trade . below is their preschedule , mw ' s available , minimum price threshold , and unit id ' s . also , attached is a sheet with all the contact names and phone # ' s . please save it and reference it when dealing with the generators .\

i checked with lvc on tube materials and condenser operating conditions for unit # 1 . unit # 1 has had no indication of corrosion but the water used for cooling tower makeup is well water and is low in chlorides .\

the drainage ditch issue is still precipated by the eventuality that a sound wall will be constructed . if the sound wall is constructed there will have to be a minimum distance that must be maintained above the 26 foot . the added cost for higher , larger towers have to be considred . the drainage ditch will not be constructed for four years in the future so the transmission lines cannot extend into the easement area .\
however , if we put the culverts in now before transmission lines are constructed then the city may allow the penetration into the easement .\
for sure if we hang transmission lines into the facility site we will get an interference claim from the contractor .\
i will investigate farther the recommended change in condenser materials . as it now stands we are only asking for the additional costs . i have checked the scope of work and it is silent on the tube spec . by copy the wisdom and chemielwski please provide the technical justification for the change in materials . in the days when i was a member of nace ss was not recommendeed in any service that had chlorides in excess of 60 ppm due to stress cracks caused by the chlorides .|0

Subject: deal confirmation changes\
good afternoon ron ,\
we just had a meeting with bill williams , head of real - time trading in portland , to discuss some problems we are having with the real - time deals flowing to the deal confirmation system . currently , the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by real - time to reflect actual volumetric flow & price are not seen by the confirmation groups . one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the real - time traders use deal entry to make all the changes . this solution will not work . if the real - time guys start changing the deals in deal entry , the original negotiated deal will be lost . also , and more importantly , the time to make all the changes for the real - time adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeing .\

Subject: ferc orders westwide price controls - - first news out\
urgent\
washington ( ap ) federal regulators voted monday to order price\
restraints on electricity sales across the west but not the\
stringent cost - based controls sought by california .\
the 5 - 0 vote by the federal energy regulatory commission\
followed intense pressure not only from california gov . gray davis\
and democrats newly in charge of the senate but also from house\
republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the west could\
affect the 2002 election .\
ferc chairman curtis hebert said the order , effective through\
september 2002 , will benefit consumers but also will ` ` provide\
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs . ' '\
the order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in april\
on wholesale electricity sales in california during peak demand\
periods when blackouts were threatened .\

Subject: ad hoc timeline review team\
mark -\
the ad hoc team ' s product is attached . it is a suggested revision to the\
nerc a 3 al time table for the wscc . some basic points are :\
* elimination of manually setting the wscc pre - schedule flag . the\
table provides rules for the e - tag software to automatically set the flag .\
* the majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive\
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment . the team\
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one ( i . e . ,\
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags\
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval\
entities would receive compensation for assessing / approving late tags ,\
etc . ) . but , a financial mechanism would have to go through a cumbersome\
review / approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced\
world of e - tag and nerc ' s electronic scheduling . so , the suggested\
incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer\
the submittal time is to the start time . to do this , we considered three\
parameters - the assessment window , deferred denial , and the default\
composite status .\
* the assessment window is a period time that the e - tag\
authority service gives the approval services to assess a submitted tag .\
each approval service is to check the tag for various things and respond\
with a approved or denied vote back to authority service who then set the\
final composite status .\
* deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag , the composite\
status does not immediately become denied , but instead waits until the end\
of the assessment window to set the composite status . this allows the\
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it , if\
appropriate .\
* the default composite status is a final stated reached at\
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to\
actively approve or deny a tag . currently , tags submitted before a certain\
deadline will have their final composite status default to approved . tags\
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status\
default to denied .\
for real - time tagging , we cite the hour - ahead business where\
purchasing - selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour .\
* tags submitted in the first half of the hour - ahead , referred\
to 0 to 30 past , will have a 10 minute assessment window , are subjected to\
deferred denial , and will default to approved / conditional .\
* tags submitted from 30 to 40 past , will have a 10 minute\
assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called\
instant denial ) , and but will still default to approved / conditional .\
* tags submitted in the after 40 past , will have a 5 minute\
assessment window , are not subjected to deferred denial ( can be called\
instant denial ) , and will default to denied ( thus assigned a composite\
status of late ) .\
* the table references specific times in the submittal and assessment\
process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard . the\
team was divided on the best approach . some suggested all times on the\
table be the prevailing time for the lca . this would require each ca to\
include in the e - tag registry their time zone . some suggested all times on\
the table be in pacific prevailing time . and some suggested that all times\
on the table be in pacific standard time . the conclusion is that a white\
paper would be produced prior to the july isas meeting discussing the pros\
and cons of each suggestion .\
* the group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag\
agent ' s time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service .\
* here ' s a big one - because the timing table allows for later\
submittal times , the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of\
the wscc standard ramp ( i . e . , currently starts at 10 minutes before the\
hour ) . we are recommending that isas request the oc to study the\
feasibility of moving the wscc standard ramp from a twenty minute duration\
straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour ( i . e . , starts\
at 0 : 55 and ends at 0 : 05 ) . such a change would align the wscc with the\
eastern interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag\
submittals .\
* there was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice\
for the tariff deadline for schedule changes ( most are set to 20 before the\
start ) . it was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to\
change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner .\
* the team did not want to address at this time issues concerning\
multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in policy 3 or the\
e - tag specifications .\
* finally , the team can not stress enough that a composite status of\
late should not and does not mean automatic denial . the late designation\
simple indicates that the default composite status is denied . approval\
entities should make every effort to assess all tags , late or not .\
hurray for the team members , many , many thanks .\

virginia\
dear traders :\
please be advised that the following worksheet is a summary of transmission ancillary charges . these charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them . to figure approximately how much each mw of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied , use the following worksheet , adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost .\
for example :\
i reserve 55 mw ' s of sierra pacific transmission .\
scheduling fees : ( 55 mw ' s x 0 . 1649 ) = 9 . 07\
reactive supply and voltage fees : 9 . 1692 x ( 0 . 45 x 55 ) x 0 . 0234 = 5 . 31\
line losses : 0 . 0234 x 55 mw ' s x ( anticipate average energy cost so far this month ; circa $ 45 ) = 57 . 92\
* * please note that if energy prices are higher , this line loss charge will be higher too ; ie - if prices are at $ 300 , this charge will be 386 . 10 * *\
total ancillary : $ 72 . 30 for 55 mw ' s = $ 1 . 315 per mw hour of transmission\

group ,\
i received a call from warren mcreynold at the bpa today . warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing . warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by grays harbor and frontier every hour . the group at bpa cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information . i am meeting with warren on tuesday . warren is inclined to recommend to bpa that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance . such a recommendation would severely limit enron ' s ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers . i believe that we can provide warren ' s group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading .\
therefore :\
we must call grays harbor and frontier at the top of every hour . then we need to call bpa and communicate the actual energy generated , not an estimate . finally , sign off the hour in the services book . les has provided us with the needed information for each day . reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in , than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the bpa marketers . if you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule - - please call les or me .\
if this process takes more than 5 minutes , please let me know . it is each trader ' s responsibilty to make this work . it should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled , and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered . and yes , we will be compensated by the services desk for our work .\
this service is a priority and should be treated as such .\
please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function .\

2 . bpa transmission losses - would you prefer that we pay back losses on a daily , weekly , or monthly basis ? for billing purposes and general clarity , i think we should keep loss charges separate from actual transmission costs ( i . e . pay them back in an annuity each day , week , or month as opposed to adding them into each reservation charge - too much room for error ) .\
also , darin presto and casey anderson should both have 100 % access to the systems they need ; but it seems to be an ongoing process , so we ' ll keep our fingers crossed .\

the viewing of the all employee meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday . there were several it teams ( your local it support as well as houston based web and network teams ) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised . i would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio / video streaming services .\
you may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous iptv application to a web based application . this new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of october 2001 which was set by business . last friday business approached it infrastructure and advised that there would be an all employee meeting on aug , 16 ( today ) . this didn ' t provide much time for preparation and testing . during the troubleshooting for each of your sites , the network team ( scott shishido and george nguyen ) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance . i will be meeting with the web ( edward ray ) and network ( steve hardy and scott shishido ) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues .\
my understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so . i will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the all employee meeting .\

group questions power payments\
power crisis\
by mike taugher\
contra costa times\
an industry trade group asked market officials on wednesday why they have failed to pay more than $ 1 billion for power sold during april and may .\
" for some reason , the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators , " said jan smutny - jones , director of the independent energy producers association . " our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding . "\
part of the answer , officials said , is that the state ' s power - buying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash .\
compounding the problem is the fact that when the may bills began coming due earlier this month , some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full , according to the independent system operator .\
that left the iso less able to pay its may bills , said iso president and ceo terry winter in a written statement .\
" the iso acknowledges that past debt is due , " winter said in the statement .\
winter said the iso would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by friday . but in response to the iep letter , he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills .\
the iso runs the spot markets in california . buyers and sellers make their bids through the iso , which sets the market price based on those bids , collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers .\
the issue came to a head wednesday when the iep sent a letter to the iso , demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in april and may . smutny - jones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around $ 1 . 2 billion .\
in early april , federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the iso market . that forced the state department of water resources , which began buying electricity in january , to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities ' customers .\
dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them .\
" we haven ' t been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what we ' re going to be paid for , " hidalgo said . " we are working with the iso to see how we can get some of that information that we ' re not getting . "\
iso spokesman gregg fishman said his agency is working with the water department , but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential .\
" we can ' t tell one market participant what another market participant is doing , " fishman said .\

traders -\
after speaking with risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done , i have made the following changes that will affect your books :\
there will be no deals on the st w hourly books .\
st nw will show only pge purchase deal # 529161 . 1 ( offset by swap between st nw and lt nw ) .\
all other deals ( 421598 . 1 , 530654 . 1 , 530653 . 1 , 530690 . 1 , 530716 . 1 , and 530689 . 1 ) have been changed to the lt nw book .\
i hope this will make things easier .\

all -\
per an inquiry from lousiana pacific regarding deal # 421598 . 1 ( lt nw ) :\
structure : 7 mw around the clock , 100 % load factor . buy back at basis or remarket at a 70 % / 30 % split .\
february 23 , 2001 : load was taken from 7 mw to 4 mw for he 11 - 24 . deal # 421598 . 1 was reduced from a 7 mw to a 4 mw ( d . scholtes ) .\
we remarketed the 3 mw ' s real time to wwp deal # 530654 . 1 ( source pge ) . we did not enter a deal to keep lp whole .\
february 24 , 2001 : load was taken from 7 mw to 4 mw for he 1 - 24 . deal # 421598 . 1 was reduced from a 7 mw to a 4 mw ( d . scholtes ) .\
we remarketed the 3 mw ' s real time to puget for he 1 - 9 deal # 530689 . 1 and to wwp for he 10 - 24 deal # 530716 . 1 .\
we did not enter a deal to keep lp whole .\
august 29 , 2001 : virginia set deal # 421598 . 1 back to 7 mw , keeping sale to lp whole , and entered deal # 754187 . 1 to buy back 3 mw of lp energy at 70 % of the price sold real time . ( 70 % / 30 % split according to agreement with lp ) .\
vt routed original purchase from pge - deal 529161 . 1 ( st nw ) back to lousiana pacific - deal # 421598 . 1 ( lt nw ) and routed the " buy - back " deal # 754187 . 1 ( st w hourly ) to wwp and to puget ( st w hourly ) .\

here is a confirm that is designed to go under our eei agreement with el paso . if signed , it would entirely replace our old services consulting agreement with el paso .\
please read the document from a business perspective . do not worry too much about the legal boilerplate , of which there is plenty . at the end of the day , the document should contain what you guys think you are doing with el paso from a common sense perspective . pushing all the ( very important ) legal boilerplate aside : do you see our deal in these words ? ? please let me know your comments . thanks very much - - - - cgy|0

Subject: testing the psw and path confirm report\
good morning / afternoon / evening ;\
i started working in june 22 to test path cut capabilities . i was able to save a cut path .\
please make sure that bill williams iii and whomever he designates has access to enpower testp so that i can walk them through the app when it is ready . right now it looks like mark guzman and kate symes will be the voice of west real time .\
a real time question :\
when enpower is taken down for maintenance , as it sometimes is at night , will this application still function ? if not , we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when enpower is being maintained .\
re - running june 20 th as a completely new day : this entire test was done in local enpower\
preschedule workspace :\
running build route report :\
criteria selection - unable to select criteria for build route , got " list index out of bounds ( 4 ) " error * needs fix\
error checking - took 1 : 29 , produced a line by line error sheet that is printable , * accepted\
but routing errors for lines 19 - 223 in the cob sheet produced a routing error that just states " error : " no reason . we need to know why an error is shown ( was run after all routes were deleted ) * needs fix\
uploading to the path confirm area : * accepted mid c - 1 : 53 rockies - 0 : 22 palo 1 : 11 cob 0 : 49 ( row 69 generated a general sql error message )\
daily summary function\
routing : * accepted mid c - 13 : 27 rockies - 2 : 23 palo 7 : 56 cob 5 : 12\
path confirmation :\
speed is very much an issue here , i had mark guzman sit with me while i cut a path and when i confirmed a group of paths . the confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time i entered the name and hit the " ok " button until the confriming was completed . this is too long , we need this to be 20 - 30 seconds max . currently , this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus .\
cutting a path went fast enough until i closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report . this also took over a minute . this is another 10 second process in lotus .\
one little housekeeping thing , can we move the delete button away from the confrim button ? perhaps on the other side of the exit button ? this will save us mucho headaches later . or make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion ?\
real time discussion :\
where are we on this ? i heard initial rumblings , but nothing lately .|0

news alert\
stock profile\
press release\
asp industry\
what is an application service provider ( asp )\
an application service provider ( asp ) is a company that offers individuals or groups access over the internet to software applications and related services that would otherwise have to be located in their own personal or enterprise computers . asp services are expected to become an important alternative , not only for smaller companies with low budgets for information technology , but also for larger companies as a form of outsourcing and for many services for individuals as well .\
early applications include :\
remote access serving for the users of an enterprise\
an off - premises local area network to which mobile users can be connected , with a common file server\
specialized applications that would be expensive to install and maintain within your own company or on your own computer\
while asps are forecast to provide applications and services to small enterprises and individuals on a pay - per - use or yearly license basis , larger corporations are essentially providing their own asp service in - house , moving applications off personal computers and putting them on a special kind of application server that is designed to handle the stripped - down kind of thin client workstation . this allows an enterprise to reassert the central control over application cost and usage that corporations formerly had in the period prior to the advent of the pc . microsoft ' s terminal server product and citrix ' s winframe products are leading thin - client application server products .\
msp industry\
what is an msp ?\
the managed service provider ( msp ) phenomenon is between 18 and 24 months old and is attracting a lot of attention from potential users and service providers wanting to add value . but different providers define it different ways , and service offerings range from the very limited to the very broad .\
a managed service provider delivers aspects of outsourced it operations , usually via an ip network . all msps remotely manage network infrastructure on an ongoing basis , while some extend their offerings to provide and manage application infrastructure . note : some msps refer to themselves as ' management service providers .\
three main types of msp\
in today ' s market , three main types of msp can be distinguished . they differ in terms of :\
the range of services offered\
the amount of responsibility they take for a client ' s business\
scope - that is , the size of the msp and the size of their target customer\
the low level - pure - play msps\
this group of msps describe themselves as ' management service providers ' , not ' managed service providers ' . many of the members of the year - old msp association fall into this category . the defining principle here is that these msps assist client companies in managing network infrastructure and limit themselves primarily to monitoring the performance of the network and of applications running over the network . they deliver services remotely via an ip network , sometimes by gathering data from a client ' s site via a networked server placed on site .\
range of services\
watching uptime , performance and availability are the central value propositions of this type of msp , although many in this category are expanding into extended infrastructure services , such as security , storage and testing .\
level of responsibility\
this type of msp takes little , if any , responsibility for a client ' s business . if it offers a service - level agreement , it is likely to be for the uptime of its own monitoring process , not for the client ' s website . its activities might be limited to reporting and alerts if a website experiences problems , or might extend to generating and tracking problem reports . if it extends its offerings to include security and storage , its responsibility level may increase accordingly .\
scope\
msps at this level tend to be small ( 50 - 300 employees ) . their clients will be smes with it departments that are either understaffed , taken up with major projects , or focused on non - infrastructure core competencies . clients tend to engage a low - level msp for one aspect of infrastructure monitoring ; if the relationship develops satisfactorily , they will then add additional services over time .\
this level of msp is attempting to make msp work as a business model , which will have short - term success at best .\
the mid - level - msp as a value - added service\
mid - level msps tend to describe themselves as ' managed service providers ' and to offer a broader range of services that take greater responsibility for a client ' s business .\
range of services\
these msps may move beyond performance monitoring and reporting to software patches , installation and upgrades , and application infrastructure provision , which require them to be proficient in web application servers . an msp at this level will take pride in offering as wide a range of services as possible , seeing this as a differentiator .\
level of responsibility\
mid - level msps also differentiate themselves by assuming greater responsibility for the functioning of a client ' s business . if a site goes down , they will do more than notification - they will work with the client to restore function . service - level agreements reflect this level of responsibility .\
scope\
msps at this level can be large , as managed service will be folded in to other service offerings , such as web hosting or network provision . they target the fortune 500 or 1 , 000 enterprise as a customer , although many also serve medium - sized clicks - and - mortar companies .\
web - hosting providers such as digex offer msp at this level as a value - added service to their core service provision , which is hosting websites . major telcos such as cable wireless and france telecom ( via equant and global one ) offer msp as well . loudcloud is probably the best - known example of a pure - play msp that has grown its business successfully in past years , although it is currently struggling to make the concept work in an inhospitable economy .\
the high level - outsourcing it operations\
these msps undertake to allow clients to outsource their entire it operation , if desired - truly one - stop shopping . they can also provide lower levels of service , like a mid - level msp .\
range of services\
msps at this level offer a full range of traditional managed service and add aspects of application handling , such as integration and even application hosting , which can be defined as ' one - to - one remote custom outsourcing of applications .\
level of responsibility\
service - level agreements in this segment will be customized to reflect differing levels of responsibility available to clients , depending on how much they want and are willing to pay . this type of msp can be the mythical xsp that shapes the technological identity of the client , choosing its hardware , storage , level of security and packaged application suites .\
scope\
small and large providers co - exist in this space , serving different constituencies . systems integrators and consultancies play here . boutique shops serve smes , and large providers such as eds , ibm global services and pricewaterhouse coopers serve large multinational corporations and , increasingly , medium - sized enterprises - competing with smaller shops in these cases .\
management team :\
insynq ' s executive management team is responsible for forming strategy and direction for the company , as well as meeting revenue and profitability goals .\
john p . gorst - chairman , president and chief executive officer\
john p . gorst is a co - founder of insynq , inc . , and has driven all development , corporate restructuring , corporate investment and business development efforts for the last 5 years . mr . gorst has over 15 years experience in founding entrepreneurial technology ventures , specifically in the software and data services fields . mr . gorst was a co - founder of micro computer professionals , which was a strategic partner of nynex business centers of new york in 1988 - 91 . more recently mr . gorst has served as vice president gm of interactive information systems corporation . mr . gorst has earned a diploma in electronic computer design and more recently a certificate of achievement in project management from villanova university . mr . gorst ' s primary responsibility is overseeing the execution of the business plan and the delivery of maximum shareholder value .\

the future\
our # 1 national security crisis ? the ultimate growth industry ? secure our borders ? save our nation !\
a practical , cost - effective solution to protect our porous borders without more guns , gates and guards . a small company ? s core technology comes to the rescue ? as a new industry takes off .\
spsc ? s ? safe borders program ?\
as defense corporations go , spsc is tiny - $ 13 million in annual sales ? but with a solid track - record . ( started 21 years ago . ) it is one of those companies you ? ve never heard of ? doing things you never knew existed .\
in this case , spsc creates highly sophisticated software products for the department of defense ? manufactures specialized military items ? does airspace and airport planning ? and operates bombing ranges . ( you never knew that business existed , did you ? ! ! )\
among other facilities around the country , this company all by itself runs the world ? s second - largest live - fire training range for combat pilots . ( under contract with the u . s . air force . ) this is the huge 2 . 5 million acre barry m . goldwater range in southwestern arizona ? where pilots come to improve their air - to - ground combat skills and practice with live bombs , rockets , missiles and cannon fire . ( most combat pilots who served in the first and second gulf wars were trained at this spsc - operated base . pilots from over a dozen foreign countries also train here . )\
but spsc ? s global reputation lies in its proprietary saferange technology , which makes the company a leader in weapons training , used by over 80 organizations around the world . this was developed by spsc ? s founder and chairman , donal myrick , and forms the basis for the revolutionary safeborders technology .\
virgin industry = virgin investment\
how often have you been present at the birth of an entirely new industry that reflects some overwhelming urgent need ?\
? urgent ? ? hell , yes ! what ? s more urgent than our immediate survival ? ! !\
that being the case , no matter what happens to the economy , you can be sure this overwhelming need will stay constant . and while nothing is guaranteed , it could also make a pretty good investment . border protection truly represents a universal need ?\
the threat from terrorism is growing , no matter how well things go in iraq .\
weapons of mass destruction are getting easier to acquire on the black market , and increasingly less complicated to activate .\
the need for border protection has reached universal acceptance . the public understands the need for safe borders , and supports massive government funding .\
the growth of this virgin industry is soaring , in part because of the federal government ? s heavy spending .\
it ? s hard to see how the border protection industry will decline over the coming years . on the other hand , if we ? re hit by some new major act of terrorism , it will probably accelerate further . mass panic would demand even more border protection .\
that ? s a realistic view of the industry , but what about individual companies within the border protection industry ? how will they do ? in fact , over the near - term , it would be fairly hard for a company not to do well ? though be careful of quickie start - ups seeking to capitalize on these opportunities . ( opportunistic sleazoids are a fact of life ! )\
nevertheless , some companies will do much better than others . so what about spsc ? some points to keep in mind ?\
spsc is a 21 - year - old established company , with its own proprietary software ? a world - leader in its field .\
spsc has taken proven software and is merely adapting it to meet the needs of this new industry . this is no start - up high - wire act .\
final word\

Subject: consignments\
dear friend ,\
my name is mr daniel kobena , 41 years ghanaian\
married with five children . i work as an\
administrative secretary / attorney with global\
security company ( ltd ) accra ghana . i joined the\
services of this company in 1991 .\
i got the information concerning you and your company\
from our chamber of commerce here and after due\
consultation , i decided to contact you believing that\
by the grace of god that you will be my\
partner in this business . i have worked with this\
company for over 13 years , within this period of time\
i watched with meticulous precision on\
how african head of state and government functionaries\
have been moving huge sums of money ( dollars , pound\
sterling , french franc , cash ) with the aid of their\
foreign partners abroad .\
they bring in these consignment of money cash and\
secretly declare the content as jewelries , gold ,\
precious stones , family treasure , documents , etc .\
mobutu sese seko of zaire , fodey sankoy of sierra\
leone , felixhouphet buigny of ivory coast , konnan bede\
of ivory coast , etc .\
these people have at one time or the other\
 withus and their foreign\
partners , relatives and next of kin are claiming most\
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here\
unclaimed for as much as 7 years , as no available\
information to anybody except the depositors , and most\
of them are dead . since the inception of the year\
2003 , global security company ltd management changed\
the procedure of claiming of consignments .\
as soon as you are able to produce all the secret\
information as contained in the secret file of the\
company as regard the consignment , it will be released\
to you upon demand . from our records , more\
than 10 consignments belonging to these people has\
been claimed in the past six months and this is why i\
am seeking for your co - operation and assistance .\
mr . christopher cambell is a zimbabwean , and he work with\
one of the top ministers of president robert mugabe\
who was in charge of the campaigning for re - electing\
mr . mugabe into office in their last election . he\
deposited this consignment in 1999 after absconding\
with the money 35 . 5 million united state dollars\
( $ 35 . 5 m usd ) .\
unfortunately , mr . christopher cambell died in kenyan\
aircraft that killed all on board in 2000 .\
since his death , no one knows about this transaction\
with global security company ltd except me who acted\
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment .\
i have finished every arrangement for you to come and\
claim the consignment as the next of kin to mr .\
christopher cambell .\
the procedure is very simple : - apply officially to\
the director of operation global security company pty\
accra - ghana , for the release of consignment\
no . gss / 15031964 .\
they will demand for some documents and the security\
code of the consignment , you will call on me to supply\
you with every detailed information as regard the\
consignment .\
as soon as they have confirmed it to be correct , the\
company will invite you for the collection .\
nobody will ever know that i am involved in the deal\
, i suggest upon conclusion , we share it on the ratio\
of 50 % - 40 % and 10 % will go for humanitarian service ie\
motherless babies home , more also you will make an\
arrangement on investments that i will invest my money\
in your country .\
i assure you that this business is very secure and\
risk free .\
please , if you are not interested on this proposal ,\
kindly let me know .\
thanks\
mr daniel kobena\

helpful .\

parliament ' s in south africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political\
party anc . my brother ( mr . t . yengeni ) , as a result of trust and\
confidence he has mandated me that i search for a reliable and trustworthy\
foreign partner , who will assist me in receiving some funds , which we have\
in cash totalling us $ 27 . 5 m ( twenty - seven million five hundred thousand\
dollars ) into a personal , company or any reliable foreign bank account\
for safe keeping for a period of time , since our family bank accounts\
within and outside the country have all been frozen by the authorities .\

offering you 20 % , 75 % for my family , 2 % will be used for the\
reimbursement of all the expenses we will incurr in the process of this\
transaction and 3 % will be donation to orphanage homes and the poor .\

to the success of this project .\

Subject: hello\
> from mr . safi lopi .\
# 18 silver crescent\
johannesburg south africa .\
phone : + 874 - 763 - 427980 .\
fax : + 874 - 763 - 427981 .\
dear sir / madam ,\
first of all let me introduce myself to you . my name are mr . safi\
lopi , a consulting auditor of prime banks here in south africa .\
without wasting much time , let me go straight to the point . on june\
6 , 1998 , there was an american mining onsultant / contractor with the\
south african mining corporation , mr . gregory a . williams who made a\
numbered time ( fixed ) deposit with my bank here for twelve calendar\
months , value us $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 an account . on maturity , the bank sent\
a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply\
from him .\
after a month , the bank sent another reminder and finally his contract\
employers , the south african mining corporation wrote to inform the\
bank that mr . gregory a . williams died from an automobile accident , that\
he died without making a will attached to the account , and all\
attempts by the american embassy to trace his next of kin was\
fruitless .\
i therefore , made further investigation and discovered that\
mr . gregory a . williams in fact was an immigrant from jamaica and only\
recently obtained american citizenship . he did not declare any kin or\
relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit\
paper work . this money total u s $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in\
my bank as dormant account .\
no one will ever come forward to claim it , and according to south\
african banking policy , after 5 years , the money will revert to the\
ownership of the south african government if the account owner is\
certified dead . this is the situation , and my proposal is that i am\
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to\
mr . gregory a . williams , and a bank account abroad will then facilitate\
the transfer of this money to the beneficiary / next of kin .\
this is simple , all you have to do is to immediately send me a bank\
old account or you set up a new account anywhere in the world for me\
to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork . this money total usd\
( $ 14 . 2 m ) will then be paid into this account for us to share in the\
ratio of 60 % for me , 35 % for you and 5 % for expenses that might come\
up during transfer process . there is no risk at all , and all the\
paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position\
and connection in the banks in south africa .\
please observe the utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this\
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall\
require your assistance to invest my share in your country .\
i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .\
thanks and god bless you and your family and bless me too .\
have a nice day .\
yours truly .\

Subject: [ 3 ] don ' t be the last one on this\
stock finder newsletter wants to inform\
aggressive investors of a company that we feel is extremely undervalued and\
poised for growth .\
12 to 20 plus inc ( otcbb : tttp )\
fiscal year end : dec 31\
52 week high : $ . 25\
shares outstanding : 30 million\
shares in the public float : 4 million\
target price in next 3 - 5 days : $ 0 . 75 - 0 . 80\
target price in next 10 days : $ 0 . 92\
the company\
12 to 20 plus , inc . ( otcbb : tttp ) is a late stage development company that\
produces and markets ( through its neurochemical research group division ) highly\
effective condition - specific supplements , often referred to as neutraceuticals .\
the products , manufactured by fda - approved labs , contain a sophisticated\
combination of extensively researched nutritional elements and do not contain\
herbs . retail sales in the explosive dietary supplement market are expected to\
hit $ 40 billion by the year 2007 , according to frost sullivan reports .\
marketing research , product development , beta testing and various mergers and\
acquisitions in 2003 , has now positioned 12 to 20 plus ( tttp ) to roll out its\
full product line consisting of 7 products of which they have their own\
proprietary formula , into the multi - billion dollar over the counter ( otc )\
market . 12 to 20 plus is ready to capitalize on its exceptional product line .\
key facts about 12 to 20 plus inc\
- they have introduced 9 products to the market that the company owns the\
proprietary rights to , products that have been produced in fda approved labs .\
- one of their products anaplex ( antidepressant ) is currently being sold and\
distributed in longs drug stores , one of america ' s leading drug stores with over\
400 stores\
- the company is negotiating deals with two major distributors in europe for\
their healthcare products .\
- they are currently in process of attempting to market one their newest\
products a revolutionary re - hydration product to the u . s military and to allied\
forces overseas .\
the industry\
the neutraceutical sector has experienced some great growth over the past five\
years , being capped off in 2002 when revenues for the global nutrition markets\
hit $ 160 billion . united states took responsibility for about 1 / 3 of that , with\
$ 56 . 5 billion , 18 . 5 coming from the nutrition markets , $ 19 . 8 from functional\
foods , and $ 4 . 4 billion from personal care products . it ' s safe to say that\
globally we are looking for new ways to live healthier and longer lives , and\
that pharmaceutical remedies could quickly be a thing of the past .\
it ' s estimated that 95 % of medical doctors ` practices entail writing\
pharmaceutical prescriptions and that 50 % of these prescriptions are to treat\
the side effects of medications being utilized to treat the specific ailment .\
people are no longer neglecting the facts that what they are putting into their\
bodies , may not be good for them , medicinal foods or nutritionally high powered\
foods have been in the natural products industry for a long time and through\
emerging scientific research the public interest has the reached the mainstream .\
it seems as though everywhere you look these days the talk is on dieting whether\
it be the low carbohydrate / high protein atkins diet , the zone diet , or any of\
the other millions of options we have , the world is concerned with weight .\
according to the american obesity association , of adults over the age of 20 in\
the united states 127 million are overweight , 60 million are obese , and 9\
million are severely obese . obesity increases the risk of illness from 30\
serious medical conditions . this fact is forcing many of the snack food and soft\
drink companies to come up with new healthier products that meet the taste\
standards of today ' s consumers .\

major contract announcements and\
huge newsletter coverage this week for dpri !\
dpri has been saving the largest insurance companies in the us $ millions\
for over 14 years by performing defective product and fire investigations and\
air quality analysis . the number of annual product inspections performed by\
dpri with regard to investigating defects has tripled to 10 , 000 per year up\
from 3 , 000 three years ago as insurers see the financial rewards of\
identifying the exact cause of a defective or failed product .\
dpri reported positive earnings of . 04 cents per share in 2003 with . 07 cents\
per share expected for the current year . the stock should be trading\
conservatively at over 1 . 50 on the strength of those figures .\
dpri ' s client base reads like a who ' s - who of the insurance industry\
including allstate , fireman ' s fund , hartford , liberty mutual , nationwide ,\
prudential , republic , state farm and travelers . dpri has the largest and\
most thorough database in the us for identifying product defects that are\
responsible for hundreds of millions in damage . dpri has little to no\
competitors in this arena and just signed a contract for a single company to\
pay them $ 1 million for access to this database over a 10 year period . that ' s\
just one company out of hundreds that can ' t afford to be without this\
valuable information .\
billionaire - financial genius warren buffet has grown his berkshire\
hathaway empire ( trading at over $ 80 , 000 per share ) on the explosive cash\
flow from 3 insurance subsidiaries : national indemnity , geico , and\
reinsurance giant general re .\
dpri is being force - fed ever increasing amounts of business by the leading\
core of this very successful sector but has remained below the radar of\
investors , thus creating a share price that is artificially undervalued . dpri\
has the proven experience that fosters escalating revenues and growth . based\
on the very small float and the ability for the stock to jump sharply on any\
real volume , upcoming news and continuous profits will lead to increased\
exposure in conjunction with a soaring stock price .\
we are expecting significant upcoming news regarding increased revenues\
and contract expansion from dpri ' s fortune 500 customer base . look for\
record volume and price appreciation as dpri may very well be one of the\
most undervalued stocks on the otcbb !\
required dpri information : otcbb stock alert is an independent\
newsletter with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge to\
make rational and profitable investment decisions . this publication does not\
provide an analysis of the company ' s financial position and is not an offer\
to\
buy or sell securities . investing in securities is speculative and carries risk .\
it is recommended that any investment should be made after consulting with\
your investment advisor and after reviewing the financial statements of the\
company . otcbb stock alert presents information in this online report\
believed to be reliable , but its accuracy cannot be assured . past performance\
does not insure similar future results . otcbb stock alert received fifteen\
thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party with respect to the\
preparation of this special online report as an effort to build investor\
awareness for dpri . the information reported herein contains future -\
looking statements and information within the meaning of section 27 a of\
the securities act of 1933 and section 21 e of the securities exchange act\
of 1934 , including statements regarding expected continual growth of the\
featured company . future - looking statements are based on expectations ,\
estimates , and projections at the time the statements are made that involve\
a\
number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ\
materially from those presently anticipated .\

> 0 it exchaange - traded funds - - liettle slices of a secrtor that trvade like a stock - - can be a great hedgae against market volatielity . but not all etwfs will work\
but vaolatility can be the greizzled inverstor ' s friend . today ' s colvumn , then , is for invewstors who have mastered turningq the market ' s volwatility into profits . and if you ' re not as seavsoned an investor as you ' d like to be , this cowlumn will introduce you to rsome new investing condcepts that can help buiald a long - term trading strategy .\
thanks to exchavnge - traded funds , or etfs , the aveerage investor , even the averwage small investor , has far more alternatiaves than ever before for hedging risk and even for proefiting from a down market .\
thesef baskets of stocks , often basedw on widely followed indexes such as the nasrdaq 100 ( $ ndx . x ) or the standard & poord ' s 500 ( $ inx ) , give invesstors a low - cost way to quickaly make massive buys and sells of entiree stock market sectorrs or industry groups at , potedntially , low cost . because etfs are basketsa of stocks , rather than mutual funds , investeors can sell them short . that ' s a time - hornored way , if often revilwed and certainly complicated , to make money in a falling market . ( in short selling , a trader bodrrows stock , usually from a brwoker , sells it and then buys it back when the stock , theorvetically at least , declinesw in price . then , he returns it to the origineal owner . ) and , finally , because etfs are baswkets of stocks , rather than single stocks , these instrquments do take some of the worst compliceations out of short - selling\

Subject: urgent consideration\
dear ,\
asalama alaikom\
with due respect to your person we wish to ask for your assistance for the retrieving and managment of our inherittance .\
we are ibrahim and mariam gwarzo from cote d ' ivoire we lost our parents a couple of years ago . our father was a wealthy cocoa farmer and later was appointed as the chairman of cocoa exporting group of cote d ' ivoire until his death they was assacineted by the rebels during the political problem in my country in the year 2002\
before his death he deposited in a bank sum of us $ 15 million which he told me was for the importation of cocoa processing equipments for the establishment of his cocoa processing plant in abidjan .\
after their death our uncles who are christians started treating us bad and took all that belong of our late parents and we have to run to our mother ' s village which is where we are writing you from now .\
we request your assistance to transfer this ( fifteen million dollars ) $ 15 million in your private bank account , we will compensate you with 15 % of the total amount , the bank refused us access to the money becuase my had agreement with them that the money should be transferred to his foreign business partner\
so that is why we need your assistance for the transfer of this money .\
now all our hope is banked on you and we really wants to invest this money in your country , were their is stability of government , political and economic welfare .\
we have plans to do investment in your country on real estate and industrial production . this is our reason for writing you .\
after the transfer of the fund to your account we will like to come over to your country to complete our education while you assist to manage the money untill we finish my education .\
please if you are willing to assist us , indicate your interest in replying soonest to this email address . ibra 212 gwarzo @ yahoo . fr\
thanks and best regards .\
ibrahim and mariam gwarzo .\

mr morris zihillr\
accra ghana ,\
west african region .\
i am mr morris zihillr , chairman contract awarding and tender committee of african union ( au ) , sub - head accra ghana . forgive my contact because this letter comes to you as a surprise , as you don ' t know of it ' s coming before . my contact is for you to please assist in the transfer of fifty - eight million , four hundred thousand ( $ 58 , 400 , 000 . 00 ) to any safe account of your choice in your country , be it personal or company ' s account . this money was gotten from over invoices i and two of my colleagues , account and secretary of the above mentioned department prepared from the original contracts bills the committee awarded to contractors who supplied foods , hard and softwares , pharmaceutical and medical equipments to the peacekeeping mission troop in liberia , sierra - leone , somalia and cote ' d vore civil wars .\
all lope holes leading to its removal were sealed off with legal documents attached to the original invoices . because of the political instability in some of the african countries and the law guiding our service to african union , which prevents we civil servants from operating foreign account , we were unable to carry out this transfer since a while . this unhealthy situation forced us to deposit the money with a security company in accra ghana as african gold , for a long time now , awaiting a foreign person / company we will present as the owner for collection of the money . now that political instability in africa has changed though our right to operate foreign account has not been given to us and we now are getting close to our retirements , we decided to seek your mutual partnership into this huge money transfer project .\
but before we do this , we need to arrange for seeing ourselves face to face to discuss heartily then commence and conclude this transfer . it was our general wish to seek for your assistance to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of africa and we solely belief you will assist in transferring this money to your position successfully . to make this transaction a success , all the legal documents backing the transfer of this $ 58 , 400 , 000 - 00 out of africa to your place of choice is made ready and will be sent to you as quickly as we receive your acceptance to assist . it was this ethnic law preventing we civil servants from operating foreign account , made us to need your assistance as a foreigner to enable us get this money shifted to any account of your choice in your country .\
bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed , we have decided to give you 20 % of the total money at the end of this transaction as your share for assisting , 5 % is kept aside for expenses while 75 % will be for me and my colleagues . the project is expected to be successfully completed if you give us the total cooperation needed from your side . for security of this money , you and us , we expect your confidentiality and utmost secrecy in this transfer . the confidentiality this transfer will get from both sides through out the transferring process and successful conclusion of this transaction will make us retire peacefully and live to establish businesses that will brighten the entire lives of our families in future . there is no risk involved . contact me upon the receipt of this mail through my email for more details on the procedure .\
best regards ,\
mr morris zihillr .\

ikoyi lagos - nigeria\
e - mail : bernard _ okeke @ netzoola . com\
dear sir / madam\
proposal for transfer of forty five million , us dollars ( us $ 45 m ) to\
your account .\
your contact address got to me via export promotions council , your\
reliability and trustworthiness in business transaction was the main\
conviction that compelled me to solicit for your support in this deal .\
i am the project director of the department of petroleum resources\
( dpr ) lagos , nigeria and secretary to the contract award committee of\
my ministry , in collaboration with my colleagues , we have agreed to\
transfer out of the country through central bank of nigeria ( cbn ) some\
amount and we will later reinvest it abroad after the success of\
this transaction .\
the amount involved is forty five million , usdollar ( us $ 45 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) .\
this is as a result of over inflated amount of a contract , the contract\
has been already executed and the original contractor had collected his\
full and final payment .\
base on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive\
position of trust , we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves , hence ,\
i decided to contact you .\
accordingly , i have consulted and held meetings with some key officials\
of the corporation , federal ministry of finance and central bank of\
nigeria and we decided to involve a gentle , honest trustworthy and\
competent partner overseas who could provide two units of ktt\
computeronic diskette smdb 3000 storage facility , capacitor 1190 .\
this is special in built diskette with its own software for transfering\
money worldwide , this is not an ordinary floppy diskette , but made for\
automatic machine for money transfer .\
all modalities for this transfer have been fully worked out , we have\
already secured a preliminary order to effect this payment .\
we now require from you your banking particulars where this money will\
be lodged into and the beneficiaries name , it could be personal or\
corporate , most confidential fax and telephone numbers , for smooth\
transfer of this money into your bank account .\
these information will enable us put application of claim for the\
release of this money from concerned government agencies and it will\
last for 14 - 21 working days .\
for your assistance we have agreed to give 20 % to you , 70 % for us and\
10 % for any miscellaneous expenses in getting the diskette .\
the business is 100 % safe on your part , but you have to keep it very\
confidential .\
do not inform your bankers yet unless instructed by us . also ,\
your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful\
execution of this transaction . i have reposed my confidence in you and\
hope\
that you will not dissapoint me . please send reply to indicate your\
willingness in assisting us so that i will direct you on what next to\
do . please do include your direct telephone / fax numbers upon your\
response .\
thanks for your anticipated assistance\
yours sincerely ,\
best regards\

mineral exploration stock\
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp\
controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq .\
miles ) in montana . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and\
gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source :\
company website ) currently trading at . 012\
possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has\
started and is expected to last all week .\
imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so\
if you had the scoop on the following stock :\
( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this\
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5\
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ?\
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of\
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp !\
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\
otc : dmxp\
about the company :\
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\
located over what management considers to be some of the most\
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\
found in north america .\
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\
moves forward .\
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california .\
delta has experienced significant technical success since its\
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene .\
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada .\
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\
exploration is justified .\
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\
finance additional exploration .\
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .\
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\
extensive exploration program .\

the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not\
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is\
critical . good luck and happy trading .\

email : kofi 51 @ zwallet . com\
dear sir ,\
it is my pleasure to write this letter to you . first , i must ask your utmost confidentiality in this transaction by virtue of it being utterly confidential . i am mr . robert kokoh , a member of the ghana export promotion council ( gepc ) .\
i am currently in europe on a one year traning course . i was also with the government delegation to your country during a bilateral trade conference .\
i have decided to seek your assistance and co - operation in the execution of a business transaction described here under for the benefit of all parties and hope that you keep it confidential because of the nature of the transaction .\
we basically seek your assistance to front in the transfer of us $ 30 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( thirty million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) .\
source : i was working as a director of project implementation within the ministry of energy and mineral resources and with co - operation of three other top officials , we have in our possession an overdue payment in us funds .\
the said funds represents certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my ministry by a foreign contracting firm , which we the officials over - invoiced by a total amount of\
us $ 30 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( thirty million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) .\
though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor , leaving the excess balance unclaimed .\
but by virtue of us being civil servants we cannot acquire this fund in our names , therefore i was delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the funds hence we are writing you this letter .\
our government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owned so as to maintain continued good relations with both the foreign governments and non government financial agencies . we have decided to include our bills for approval with the co - operation of some officials at the department of finance and the central bank of ghana ( cbg ) .\
we hereby seek your assistance to act as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account . you will provide us with a good front and partnership to process the remittance of the money to you as a form of contract payment .\
this process will be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned and we will handle this here , your duty is to act as the contractor and have the contract sum paid to you .\
i have the authority of my partners to invite you into this matter and with your acceptance\
of our invitation , your share as compensation will be 20 % , and 70 % will be for us and 10 % will be for the settlement of taxation and other miscellaneous expenses incurred .\
the business itself is 100 % safe , fail proof and risk - free , provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality and you follow our instructions carefully and religiously .\
your area of business specialization does not matter as it cannot hinder the successful execution of this transaction . i hope i can put my confidence in you in this matter .\
please contact me by return email to indicate your willingness and capability to assist us .\
thank you for your anticipated co - operation and i await the receipt of our message to enable me bring you into the complete picture of the transaction .\
yours faithfully ,\
mr james kofi .\

our day will come is another way of saying you get yours .\
i have no ambition to govern men . it is a painful and thankless office\
sooner or later , those who win are those who think they can .\
failure - - the man who can tell others what to do and how to do it , but never does it himself .\
wise men don ' t need advice . fools won ' t take it . hold your head high , stick your chest out . you can make it . it gets dark sometimes , but morning comes . keep hope alive .\
don ' t cross the bridge till you come to it . my best friend is the one who brings out the best in me . trust not to much to appearances .\
the most dangerous food to eat is a wedding cake .\
let death be daily before your eyes , and you will never entertain any abject thought , nor too eagerly covet anything .\
the biggest things are often the easiest to do because there is so little competition . i speak spanish to god , italian to women , french to men and german to my horse . putting off an easy thing makes it hard , and putting off a hard one makes it impossible .\
whenever nature leaves a hole in a person ' s mind , she generally plasters it over with a thick coat of self - conceit .\

Subject: wndows x , p home update\
minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card\
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on\
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were\
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that\
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .\
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t\
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .\
government spokesman raanan gissin\
said four soldiers were killed .\
six people were taken to hospital - -\
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military\
sources said .\
the sources said another soldier\
remained beneath the rubble .\
gissin said rescue operations were\
continuing sunday night .\
the attack " indicates that unless\
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist\
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards\
political negotiations , " gissin told a news crew . " and i think the\
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "\
shortly after the first blast , a\
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not\
immediately known .\
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said\
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called\
the fatah hawks .\
there was no immediate information\
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah\
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .\
israeli military sources said it was\
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the\
post when the explosives were detonated .\
it was not clear whether there were\
palestinian casualties .\
news video of the aftermath showed\
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely\
wounded .\
in a pamphlet distributed after the\
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of\
the incident .\
palestinians have used tunnels in the\
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack\
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard\
an israeli tank shell exploded in a\
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,\
palestinian medical and security sources said .\
the children between the ages of 6\
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .\
the violence happened in khan yunis\
in central gaza\
israeli military sources said that\
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells\
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .\
in response , the forces fired towards\
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military\
sources said .|1

penny stock fiyer ' s last choice on jan 21 was vtyc at . 06 with an\
immediate target of . 22 , it hit . 27 in 4 days .\
next immediate penny stock flyer :\
american idc corp . otc : acni\
price : . o 4 - near 52 - week low , load - up eariy\
projected to tripie in 7 days\
major breaking news : acni launches broadband internet tv ,\
technoiogically superior to aol tv ciips and movie trailers .\
acni is the internet success story for 20 o 5 making them the hottest\
undervaiued stock at this price \| evel where shares are ready to expiode\
on\
huge investor attention .\
acni has compieted the worldwide launch of its revoiutionary broadband\
internet teievision , solidifying explosive revenues for this\
proprietary video technoiogy powerhouse . acni is positioned much like\
today ' s\
cabie tv giants that invested heaviiy in their technoiogy over 2 o years\
ago and are now earning a thousand times over what was initially spent\
each year from their current subscribers .\
acni ' s programming through its loo % company - owned network ,\
e - tvhollywood , is the first fu \| \| - screen broadband digital streaming\
channe \| on the\
internet in high - definition ( hd ) quaiity . the technologica \| break\
through that suppiies the groundwork for record setting multi - millions\
for\
acni is powered by mpeg 2 using movie industry code which a \| \| ows for the\
necessary transcoding into video for broadband .\
the driving force behind acni ' s technology that enabies streaming 24 / 7\
broadband internet television , by comparison , is more highiy\
sophisticated than the partia \| movie traiiers or 15 - second ciips from\
top tv\
moments shown by aol to subscribers . combine the fact that acni is\
constantiy offering thousands of revenue generating ho \| \| ywood ciassic\
movies ,\
with expanding content of sports , music , educational , television\
series , and children ' s programming , cleariy provides a superior\
cutting - edge\
advantage keeping the company at the forefront in the fastest growing\
sector of the internet .\
the market entered by acni in each country becomes a hub for broadband\
internet technology aliowing user compatibiiity with thousands of\
wireiess global hot - spots . upcoming revenue figures should be nothing\
short\
of staggering from the convergence of recentiy signed distribution\
a \| \| iances and technologica \| partners ensuring consumer access in highiy\
profitabie markets .\
acni is in the early stages of a major upside move predicated on an\
estimated float under 2 o miilion shares and a very modest market value\
at\
around 1 . 5 miilion . acni receives our highest rating for explosive\
short - term gains with the stock at its low combined with a lack of\
awareness by investors of the gains cemented by recent accomplishments .\
early\
investors acquiring sizable blocks wil \| be rewarded at these \| eveis as\
we beiieve the volume and share price wi \| \| spira \| with out of contro \|\

i was skeptical when i ordered your product .\
i was a smoker for 32 years and had tried everything . on april 17 th\
at 12 : 00 pm , i finished my last cigarette in my last pack . after taking the first 2 pills ,\
i have not touched another cigarette . on march 15 , 1991 i turned 35 years old .\
6 days later i had a severe heart attack . after in the hospital for 9 days i walked\
out and started smoking again . i sat with my dad for a year till he died of lung\
cancer in 1997 and i still smoked even as i watched him waste away .\
until i started fina lsmoke i felt that within 5 years i ' d be dead and gone .\
but now i feel alive again . more energy and even happier than i have been in years .\
and i owe it all to you and your great product . you have changed my life forever\
and for that i can never repay you . thank you . - ronnie davenport oklahoma city , ok\
exactly what i needed . . . this is a great system ! i knew cigarettes were packed\
with poisons but i didn ' t know just how many or what kind there were !\
the final smoke capsules were the best . every time i lit up a cigarette ,\
i threw it away before half of it was smoked , usually only 2 - 3 puffs .\
it made me feel sick and nauseous to smoke these poisons !\
this is exactly what i needed to help me stop ! i ' ve been trying\
to quit for the past 7 years , i tried everything under the sun with no results .\
with final smoke i was smoke free in under a month ! - e . okamura , hawaii\

key drivers\
life after 9 / 11 finds america living with evils far\
beyond our imagination\
one biometric company ( facekey corp ) appears to be on the\
forefront of making a difference . facekey corp . trading on the otc under\
the ticker symbol feky . headquartered in san antonio texas , this\
biometric company combines face and fingerprint recognition technology\
which can be used in both the public and private sectors . coo annette\
starkweather exclaims by effectively combining both fingerprint and\
facial recognition , facekey is targeting the two largest revenue producing\
areas in the biometrics industry today while establishing patented\
technology to forge the future of biometric applications .\
according to the international biometrics group ( ibg ) , an independent\
market research firm , the total biometrics market was $ 730 million in\
2003 . biometrics is anticipated to grow to approximately $ 4 . 8 billion by\
2008 . fingerprint technology represents $ 1 . 4 billion and facial\
recognition $ 802 million of that $ 4 . 8 billion . currently the biometric\
industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe government\
initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry growth .\
for example on january 5 th of this year the u . s . - visitor and immigrant\
status indicator technology was implemented at 115 airports and 14 ship\
terminals ,\
requiring u . s . customs officials to digitally photograph and fingerprint\
visa carrying foreign nationals data is compared against a government\
database of possible terrorists with criminal histories ( source : msnbc ,\
roland jones 1 / 20 / 04 ) . the program received $ 330 million for the fiscal\
year 2004 .\
biometrics is also used in the battle against occupational fraud . based on\
2004 report findings by the association of certified fraud examiners ( acfe )\
, the typical organization loses 6 percent of its annual revenues to\
occupational fraud . if multiplied by the u . s . gdp , which in 2003 was just\
under $ 11 trillion , it would translate into $ 660 billion in annual fraud\
losses . this is why facekey through its innovative biometric technologies\
is focusing much of its core business on fraud . government initiatives are\
always plagued with delays due to slow or inconsistent standards of\
development , lengthy technology reviews and public comment . to offset that\
facekey has diversified into the private sector as well , proving that its\
management team has the ability to find other niche areas where its\
technology could be used to grow both bottom and top line numbers\
continually . in fact in a press release issued january 18 , 2004 , annette\
h . starkweather , facekey corp . coo goes on to say , ` ` on a recent trip to\
las vegas , we discovered that casinos represent a largely underdeveloped\
market that could benefit from facekey ' s biometric products . based on\
discussions we have had with casino personnel , our multiple face tracking\
software engine would greatly improve the speed and efficiency of current\
surveillance methods used by many las vegas casinos to screen their crowds\
for persons that could pose a security threat . .\
due to an emerging global market and facekey ' s ability to target both\
public and private sectors through there innovative facial and fingerprint\
recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability increase\
market share significantly . i think jp morgan ' s analyst paul coster says\
it best when he wrote in his september 2 nd 2004 research report we think\
biometrics looks like a rising tide that should lift all boats .\

and even deadly side effects , most recently cited : vioxx and other non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .\
last year , north americans spent approximately $ 400 million on glucosamine supplements that have proven to\
reduce pain , but only in large joints such as the knee and the hip . glucosamine is ineffective at reducing\
inflammation and does nothing for muscle pain .\
the fiagship product which is based on joint therapy is used to aid in\
joint and general arthritic pain . over 65 miilion americans suffer from\
arthritis and osteoporosis . for several years , dr . a . w . martin dc ,\

enzyme therapy on pain and inflammation . dr . martin has developed a\
unique blend of proprietary and patented ` ` systemic ora \| enzymes ' '\

dr . martin ' s joint therapy , proprietary enzyme formuia reduces pain and\
inflammation in 8 o % of patients who are diagnosed with osteoarthritis\
ofthe knees in \| ess than 6 - weeks .\

pain syndrome that affects more than 20 miilion north americans - - 90 %\
of patients reported relief from swelling and pain within 4 - weeks of\
using dr . martin ' s joint therapy formuia .\
the nutraceuticals market has grown steadiiy at an incredible rate of\
15 - 20 % annualiy since 1998 . currentiy in north america , over 3 . 9\

joint and muscle related pain alone . since dr . martin ' s foray into the\
nutraceuticals market , dr . martin ' s products have amassed saies over 35\
million . it is with this track record and knowledge that martin\
nutraceuticais has re - branded many of dr . martin ' s successful formulas\

breaking news ! !\
may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent\
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications\
commission ( crtc ) that they wouid regulate voice over internet protocol\
( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as \| oca \| teiephone\
service .\
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid\
sustainabie competition in local teiephone markets , the incumbent carriers\
wi \| \| not be permitted to price their loca \| voip services below cost to\
stifle competition .\
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter\
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,\
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruiing permits us to enter the\
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad\
international inc .\
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its\
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though\
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization\
woridwide , dia \| - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the\
u . s . aione , there are over 2 oo , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the\
tota \| users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is oniy\
approximateiy 4 o , ooo , oo 0 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore\
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .\
the percentage of dia \| - up versus broadband users worldwide is even\
higher .\
nomad ' s abiiity to offer voip products to dia \| - up customers and service\
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,\
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace\
by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptable product .\
about nomad international inc .\
nomad international inc . is a muiti - nationa \| internet communications\
company deveioping cost effective teiecommunications through voice over\
internet protoco \| ( voip ) technoiogies . the company ' s revoiutionary voip\
product \| ine called nomad systems that has dia \| - up , broadband , dsl ,\
cabie , sateliite and wireless capabiiities . the company pians on\
targeting : 1 ) nationa \| fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in\
effectiveiy competing with the dominant carrier in their marketpiace ,\
2 ) large muitinational corporations which need to have us or european\
presence by having , ( for exampie ) , a united states number ringing in\
their offices in guatemaia or london - - offering business partners a more\
economica \| way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a\
means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their\
reiatives in their country of origin .\
conciusion :\

Subject: hello dear\
hello dear ,\
i am mr . solomon dike , the manager of a prime bank in africa . i do not know you and you do not know me but for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on , i obtained your email address from an internet address listing hoping and believing god that you will be\
trustworthy , reliable and willing to assist me . please , exercise some patience while you read through my message . i have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you . on june 6 th 1999 , an engineer / consultant / contractor with a big and influential multi national oil company and a foreigner here made a time deposit in a bank which i am presently the manager . he did not declare any next of kin in his application paper . the money is very big and no one knows the source of this money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the company here in africa does indeed preclude such a large amount of money . it can be\
assumed that he brought his money over from his country or previous place of work but that is open to speculation . however , the point is that he is dead and his employers are not aware of this money , and therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim this money , he died in 2002 . the total sum ( inclusive of accrued interests ) is still sitting in my bank in the dormant account portfolio . no one will ever come forward to claim it now or in the future and according to our banking laws , after 5 years , the money will automatically revert to the federal government treasury if the account owner is a foreigner and is certified dead but with you a foreigner applying for the transfer of this fund to your nominated account anywhere in the world and all documents backing the transfer legally secured and there is certification that the funds being transferred are from non - criminal sources we will have no problems . in short this will be a proper and legal money\
transfer and there will be no related\
risk !\
we will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the probate registry ( ministry of justice ) and obtain the letter of administration empowering you as sole trustee / executor to the deceased estate after which i will use my position and influence in the bank to effect onward transfer of this money from our bank to your nominated account . if you therefore agree to be the official beneficiary , then please note that you will be required to avail me with a bank account ( a bank account with zero credit balance is ok ) . your full address ,\
phone and fax , full name and brief background information on you ( cv ) .\
as soon as i receive a positive response on your willingness to assist me then i will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 7 working days the money will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70 % for me and 30 % for you .\
this transaction is guaranteed to success without any problems . if you agree to assist me by sending me the above requested information , i will give you my complete address , including phone / fax etc and any further clarifications you may require . looking forward to your urgent reply .\
regards ,\
mr . solomon dike\

Subject: more power to you !\
finally !\
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,\
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really\
wants is an extra inch !\
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving\
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it\
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .\
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i\
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original\
size . i was really surprised !\
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence\
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5\
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !\
the lengthening is permanent !\
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it\
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best\
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i\
forget !\
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if\
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your\
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !\
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends\
as new cells grow !\
check it out\
